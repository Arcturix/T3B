This psychological phenomenon can trap us in a cycle of investing time, money, or effort into decisions that no longer serve our best interests, simply because we've already invested so much. </p><p>After a large financial investment, I recently had some setbacks in some of my own long-term plans  that led me to this fallacy and an investigation into it. Today, I'll delve into the sunk cost bias, exploring its implications and offering strategies to overcome it.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-yellow\"><div class=\"kg-callout-text\"><b><strong style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">What Is the Sunk Cost Bias? </strong></b>The sunk cost bias, also known as the sunk cost fallacy, is a cognitive bias that compels us to continue investing in a project, task, or decision based on the amount we've already committed, rather than on its current and future value. This bias can affect various aspects of life, from business investments to personal relationships, leading us to throw good money after bad, waste time on unrewarding endeavours, or stick with decisions that don't make us happy.</div></div><blockquote> \u201c<em>The sunk-cost fallacy keeps people for too long in poor jobs, unhappy marriages, and unpromising research projects.</em>\u201d - Daniel Kahneman</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/02/Chesterton-s-Fence-27.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1078\" height=\"739\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/Chesterton-s-Fence-27.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/Chesterton-s-Fence-27.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/02/Chesterton-s-Fence-27.jpg 1078w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">What is the sunk cost bias?</span></figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"the-psychology-behind-it\">The Psychology Behind It</h3><p>At the heart of the sunk cost bias is an emotional over-investment in our decisions. It's partially rooted in loss aversion, a concept from behavioural economics suggesting that <strong>the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining</strong>. Acknowledging that our investments\u2014be it time, money, or effort\u2014have not paid off, feels like accepting a loss, which we're psychologically wired to avoid.</p><h3 id=\"real-world-examples\">Real-World Examples</h3><ul><li><strong>Business:</strong> A company continues to invest in a failing project because it has already spent a significant amount of resources on it, ignoring the bleak prospects of future returns.</li><li><strong>Personal Life:</strong> An individual stays in a relationship or keeps pursuing a hobby that no longer brings joy, simply because of the emotional, time, or financial investment they have made.</li><li><strong>Education and Careers:</strong> Students may continue with a major they are no longer interested in, or professionals might stay in a job that doesn't satisfy them because of the time and effort they've already invested in their education or career path.</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/02/garbage.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1021\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/garbage.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/garbage.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2024/02/garbage.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/02/garbage.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Sunk Cost Fallacy - </span><a href=\"https://foreverjobless.com/sunk-cost-fallacy/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Forever Jobless</span></a></figcaption></figure><blockquote>\"<em>When people walk away from you, let them go. Your destiny is never tied to anyone who leaves you, and it doesn't mean they are bad people. It just means that their part in your story is over</em>.\" - Bishop T D Jakes</blockquote><h2 id=\"the-impact-of-sunk-cost-bias\">The Impact of Sunk Cost Bias</h2><p>The sunk cost bias can lead to suboptimal decision-making, wasted resources, and missed opportunities. It can lock individuals and organisations into paths that are no longer beneficial, preventing them from exploring potentially more rewarding alternatives.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-overcome-the-sunk-cost-bias\">How to Overcome the Sunk Cost Bias</h3><ol><li><strong>Acknowledge the Bias:</strong> Awareness is the first step to overcoming the sunk cost fallacy. Recognize when your decisions are being influenced by past investments rather than future benefits.</li><li><strong>Cultivate an Objective Perspective:</strong> Try to view your situation from an outsider's viewpoint. An objective analysis can help you see the costs and benefits more clearly without the emotional baggage of your investment.</li><li><strong>Embrace a Forward-Thinking Mindset:</strong> Focus on future costs and benefits rather than what you've already invested. Ask yourself, \"What will I gain by continuing this investment?\" and \"What are the opportunities I might miss if I keep going?\"</li><li><strong>Set Predefined Criteria for Success and Failure:</strong> Establish clear goals and benchmarks for your investments (time, money, effort) and be ready to reassess your commitment if those benchmarks are not met.</li><li><strong>Accept and Learn from Failures:</strong> Recognise that acknowledging a sunk cost can be an opportunity for learning and growth. Embracing your mistakes without letting them define you encourages smarter decision-making in the future.</li></ol><h3 id=\"the-power-of-letting-go\">The Power of Letting Go</h3><p>Understanding and overcoming the sunk cost bias is not just about minimising losses; it's about maximising future gains. It's a reminder that sometimes, the most courageous decision we can make is to cut our losses and move forward. The ability to let go of past investments, when they no longer serve our best interests, can free up resources, time, and emotional energy to invest in more promising opportunities.</p><p>In conclusion, the sunk cost bias is a pervasive and powerful force that can lead to irrational decision-making. By becoming aware of this bias and actively working to mitigate its effects, we can make more rational, beneficial decisions that align with our current and future goals. It's not always easy to cut our losses, but sometimes, it's the most strategic move we can make.</p><p>Thanks for reading. </p><p>T3B</p>",

The result? We often feel like we're under an intense spotlight, even when we're not.</p><blockquote>\u201cMaturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what\u2019s truly fuckworthy.\" - Mark Manson</blockquote><h3 id=\"why-its-hard-to-shake-off\"><strong>Why It's Hard to Shake Off:</strong></h3><p>Despite understanding the Spotlight Effect, shaking off this feeling isn't easy. Why? Because it's deeply ingrained in our self-consciousness and social awareness. We are social beings, wired to care about our reputation and how we're perceived by others. This concern, while normal, can sometimes become a crippling source of anxiety and self-doubt.</p><p>The trick is to start noticing this and start <u>making choices for yourself</u> rather than others. How much do you do just for appearances? How much do you spend to maintain your outbound persona? - If people really don't care, then only do it for yourself. Once you try it, it's quite freeing. The trick then...is to stop giving a f*ck.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/01/tim-not-giving-a-fuck.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"775\" height=\"585\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/tim-not-giving-a-fuck.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/01/tim-not-giving-a-fuck.png 775w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-red\"><div class=\"kg-callout-text\">This isn't to say you abandon everyone and become a hermit.

Here, the author addresses many issues and highlights the following:</p><p><br><strong>SUBTLETY #1</strong>: Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.</p><p><strong>SUBTLETY #2</strong>: To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity.</p><p><strong>SUBTLETY #3</strong>: Whether you realize it or not, you are always choosing what to give a fuck about.</p><blockquote>\u201cIn my life, I have given a fuck about many people and many things. I have also not given a fuck about many people and many things. And like the road not taken, it was the fucks not given that made all the difference.\u201d - Mark Manson</blockquote><h3 id=\"the-discrepancy-in-perception\"><strong>The Discrepancy in Perception:</strong></h3><p>One of the most fascinating aspects of the Spotlight Effect is the discrepancy between our perception and reality. <strong>Studies have shown that people overestimate the extent to which their mistakes or faux pas are noticed by others</strong>. </p><p>This discrepancy can lead to heightened self-consciousness and social anxiety, impacting our interactions and even our willingness to take risks or try new things.</p><h3 id=\"summary\">Summary</h3><p>The Spotlight Effect is a common psychological experience, but it doesn't have to dominate your life. By understanding and acknowledging it, you can begin to see that the spotlight shining on you is not as bright as you think. </p><p>Remember, everyone is the star of their own show, and more often than not, they're too busy with their performance to focus on yours. Let this knowledge be your stepping stone towards greater confidence and freedom in your social interactions.</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p><p>T3B</p>",

When you focus on one task, your brain is able to process information more efficiently, leading to higher quality work in less time.</p><p><strong>Reduction in Errors</strong>: Multitasking often leads to more mistakes due to divided attention. Single tasking, on the other hand, allows for a more thorough and detailed approach to each task, significantly reducing the likelihood of errors.</p><p><strong>Stress Reduction</strong>: <u>Juggling multiple tasks simultaneously can be overwhelming and stressful</u>. Single tasking simplifies your workload, making it more manageable and reducing anxiety. This clarity and calmness can lead to a more enjoyable and fulfilling work experience.</p><p><strong>Improved Memory and Learning</strong>: When you single-task, your brain is better able to absorb and retain information. This focused approach aids in learning new skills and retaining detailed information, which is often compromised when multitasking.</p><p><strong>Higher Quality of Work</strong>: Single tasking often results in higher quality outcomes. With undivided attention, tasks are completed with a greater level of care and precision, leading to better results.</p><p><strong>Long-term Productivity</strong>: While multitasking might give the illusion of productivity in the short term, single tasking contributes to more sustainable productivity.

Clason, offers invaluable advice on managing personal finances. </p><p>One of its most significant lessons is the importance of saving at least 10% of your income. This simple act of saving a small portion of your earnings can lead to substantial wealth over time, demonstrating that <u>financial security is not solely dependent on how much you earn</u>, but rather how much you save.</p><p>Saving is a habit and it\u2019s nice to cultivate that habit as soon as you can. You\u2019ll see a bunch of \u2018out of touch\u2019 savings videos on YouTube (how I saved 10,000 in a year, how I paid 200k student debt in 12 months) - but for the \u2019average Joe\u2019, no matter what you earn, this is a nice starting point. </p><h3 id=\"lessons-from-mrmoney-moustache\">Lessons from Mr.Money Moustache</h3><p>Mr. Money Mustache, a popular figure in the personal finance sphere, emphasises the value of frugality and <u>living well below one's means</u> to achieve early financial independence. </p><p>His lessons revolve around <strong>aggressive saving</strong>, <strong>wise investing</strong>, and <strong>lifestyle simplification</strong>.

      "content_html": "<p>I've written a lot about the effects of DIGITAL recently and it's a fascinating topic. Like many, I live much of my life online; I work in digital marketing, watch countless online shows, play games and endlessly browse YouTube. But in an era where our lives are intertwined with digital technology, a new cognitive phenomenon, often termed as '<em>Popcorn Brain</em>', is emerging. Credit to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LZuhy9adw\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Diary of a CEO</a> for informing me of this phrase. Let's take a deeper look at what it means:</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-yellow\"><div class=\"kg-callout-text\">This term metaphorically captures the essence of <b><strong style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">how our brains react to the constant influx of digital stimuli</strong></b>. In this blog, we'll delve into what popcorn brain is, how it's impacting our lives, and most importantly, the strategies we can adopt to mitigate its effects.</div></div><h2 id=\"what-is-popcorn-brain\">What is Popcorn Brain?</h2><p>Imagine popcorn kernels bursting in rapid succession - now apply this imagery to your thoughts and attention span. That's the essence of popcorn brain. </p><p>This non-clinical term describes a cognitive state influenced heavily by our interaction with digital media. The primary culprit? The endless streams of quick, engaging content delivered by our smartphones, social media, and online streaming platforms.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/01/Chesterton-s-Fence-22.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1118\" height=\"842\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/Chesterton-s-Fence-22.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/Chesterton-s-Fence-22.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/01/Chesterton-s-Fence-22.jpg 1118w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://community.thriveglobal.com/the-power-of-popcorn-brain/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">The Power of Popcorn Brain</span></a><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> - Dr. Aditi Nerurkar, MD, MPH</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-digital-dilemma\">The Digital Dilemma</h2><h3 id=\"1-shrinking-attention-spans\">1. <strong>Shrinking Attention Spans</strong>:</h3><p>Our ability to focus on a single task without getting distracted is dwindling. This change is akin to channel surfing - never settling long enough to dive deep into any topic, task or conversation. </p><p>I eat and I watch YouTube, I walk and I listen to music, I've even played mobile games in the shower. There is a constant need for mental stimulation and a constant distraction with the likes of our smartphones, tablets and connected devices. Take one look at a busy metro and 90% of travellers will be engrossed on their phones. Out at dinner and your partner goes to the bathroom? - what do you reach for? - it's honestly embarassing.</p><h3 id=\"2-craving-instant-gratification\">2. <strong>Craving Instant Gratification</strong>:</h3><p><strong>Rooted in Digital Feedback Loops:</strong> The craving for instant gratification is a direct result of how digital platforms are structured. Social media, for instance, rewards us with likes, comments, and shares, offering immediate feedback and rewards for our interactions. This creates a psychological loop where we begin to crave these quick responses.</p><p><strong>Dopamine and Reward Systems:</strong> Each notification or social media interaction triggers a release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward in the brain. Over time, our brains become conditioned to seek out these quick dopamine hits, reinforcing the craving for instant gratification.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/01/shareable-replacement-1000x600.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/shareable-replacement-1000x600.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/01/shareable-replacement-1000x600.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/media-consumption-covid-19/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">How COVID-19 Has Impacted Media Consumption, by Generation</span></a></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"strategies-to-counter-popcorn-brain\">Strategies to Counter Popcorn Brain</h2><h3 id=\"1-mindful-media-consumption\">1. <strong>Mindful Media Consumption</strong>:</h3><p>Awareness is the first step. I first quit social media about 13 years ago after I caught myself doomscrolling on instagram. I had a sudden realisation and epiphany that sharing my awesome life online was counterproductive and shallow. If I wanted to share great stories and experiences with friends it was better for me to do it in person. </p><p>I travelled to the US for a month for work and in that time had issues logging into my account. This 4-week break was enough to break my 'cycle' and I quit instantly.</p><p>Take stock of your own day. I wrote <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/screen-time-the-silent-thief-of-the-24-hour-day/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> about how on average, people spent 6 hours 37 minutes on their phones each day during 2023. THIS IS MAD. Put your phone away while you work, don't sleep with it by your bed and start tracking how much you're browsing online. Like me, I think you'll be surprised!</p><h3 id=\"2-digital-detox\">2. <strong>Digital Detox</strong>:</h3><p><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/tame-your-digital-monkey-conquer-your-primal-brain-and-reclaim-your-digital-life/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Periodically disconnect</a> to give your brain a much-needed respite. Engage in reading, outdoor activities, or hobbies that don't involve a screen. This is especially beneficial first thing in the morning and last thing at night.</p><p>If you're browsing for hours each day, you might be lonely. Reach out to a friend, colleague or partner and have a conversation instead.</p><h3 id=\"3-cultivating-deep-focus\">3. <strong>Cultivating Deep Focus</strong>:</h3><p>Dedicate uninterrupted time to tasks and gradually increase this duration to train your brain for deeper focus. </p><p>Remember, <strong>often starting a task is the hardest part</strong>. Just say to yourself - \"<em>I'll just do 5minutes</em>' and see how far it gets you. On top of this, this past year I've also found the wonder of 'focus music' through apps such as <a href=\"https://endel.io\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Endel</a>. I don't understand the intricacies of binaural beats, or if it's placebo, but it works - and that's what I care about.</p><p>Perhaps I can do a blog on this in the future...</p><h3 id=\"4-embracing-boredom\">4. <strong>Embracing Boredom</strong>:</h3><p>Let yourself be bored without immediately resorting to digital devices. This can boost creativity and help your brain reset to a more balanced state.</p><p>As mentioned, the trick is to catch yourself in the moment. This will take practice.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"__GHOST_URL__/the-art-of-boredom-embracing-idleness-in-a-hyper-connected-world/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">The Art of Boredom: Embracing Idleness in a Hyper-Connected World</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Embrace boredom in our hyper-connected world to boost creativity and mental well-being.

This not only frees up time for outdoor activities but also reduces the mental clutter associated with constant connectivity.</li><li><strong>Bring Nature Indoors:</strong> If access to outdoor spaces is limited, try bringing nature indoors. Indoor plants, natural light, and nature-inspired decor can help mimic the benefits of being in nature.</li><li><strong>Mindful Observation:</strong> Practice mindfulness in natural settings. Pay attention to the sights, sounds, and smells around you.

But the IKEA experience extends far beyond just purchasing affordable, flat-packed furniture. It involves the customers in the very process of creation, leading to a unique psychological phenomenon known as the 'IKEA effect'. </div></div><p>This article explores how this effect extends beyond DIY furniture assembly, influencing our perception of value, effort, and satisfaction in various aspects of life.</p><p><strong>Understanding the IKEA Effect</strong><br>The term 'IKEA effect' was coined by researchers Michael I. Norton, Daniel Mochon, and Dan Ariely. It refers to the increased value people place on products they partially created. This effect is not just about building furniture; it's about the sense of accomplishment and personal investment that comes from direct involvement in the creation process.</p><p><strong>Beyond Furniture: The IKEA Effect in Daily Life<br>The IKEA effect has implications far beyond the realm of DIY furniture</strong>. It can be observed in numerous scenarios where personal effort leads to an inflated sense of value and satisfaction. From home-cooked meals to self-assembled toys and DIY projects, when we invest our time and effort into creating something, we tend to value it more highly.<br>Businesses can leverage the IKEA effect to enhance customer engagement and satisfaction. By involving customers in the creation process of a product or service, companies can foster a deeper connection and a sense of ownership. This can range from customizable products to participatory marketing campaigns.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/01/IKEA_Effect_T3B.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1118\" height=\"842\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/IKEA_Effect_T3B.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/IKEA_Effect_T3B.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/01/IKEA_Effect_T3B.jpg 1118w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">The IKEA Effect - We place more value on products we partially created.</span></figcaption></figure><p>As a marketing professional, I was looking at this bias through the marketing-lens. The IKEA effect offers valuable insights for marketing strategies, as it highlights the increased value consumers place on products they help create or personalize. Here are five potential applications you may not have thought of:</p><ol><li><strong>Customizable Products</strong>: Offering customizable options for products, where consumers can choose colors, components, or features, can increase perceived value and customer satisfaction. For example, customizing sneakers or personalizing phone cases.</li><li><strong>DIY Kits and Experiences</strong>: Marketing products as DIY kits, like home furniture assembly or cooking meal kits, can appeal to a customers desire to be involved in the creation process. Rory Sutherland has a nice example of this with '<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaRoQmerwq8\" rel=\"noreferrer\">just add an egg</a>'. <em>(see video below)</em></li><li><strong>Customer Participation in Product Development</strong>: Inviting customers to contribute ideas or feedback during product development can increase their attachment to the product and brand. This could involve social media campaigns, customer surveys, or beta testing groups.</li><li><strong>Interactive Marketing Campaigns</strong>: Implementing interactive campaigns where customers can participate in shaping the campaign or its outcome. This could be through contests, social media challenges, or collaborative online platforms.</li><li><strong>Loyalty Programs with Personalization</strong>: Developing loyalty programs that offer personalized rewards or experiences can increase the perceived value of the program, as customers feel more involved in the reward process.</li></ol><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GaRoQmerwq8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"Rory Sutherland: The Ikea Effect and Behavioural Economics\"></iframe></figure><p><strong>The Downside: When Effort Leads to Bias</strong><br>However, the IKEA effect is not without its pitfalls. It can lead to a bias where individuals overvalue their creations, regardless of the outcome's quality. This can be problematic in professional settings where objective evaluation is crucial.</p><p><br><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>Embracing the IKEA effect can be a tool for encouraging creativity and enhancing the perception of value in everyday life. It reminds us that the journey of creation can be as rewarding as the end product.</p><p>The IKEA effect is a testament to the power of personal effort and involvement. Whether assembling furniture, cooking a meal, or embarking on a DIY project, the value we derive from these activities goes beyond the material. It's about the satisfaction, pride, and sense of accomplishment that comes from creating something with our own hands.</p><p>In a new year where I hope to create more than I consume - I hope this bias adds a bit of joy to the experience!</p><p>T3B</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"__GHOST_URL__/sturgeons-law-90-percent/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Sturgeon\u2019s Law: 90% of Everything is Crap</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Sturgeon\u2019s Law states that \u201c90% of everything is crud.\u201d In a world overflowing with content and choices, this principle reminds us to seek and value the rare 10% of true quality.</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w256h256/2023/06/3-2.png\" alt=\"\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">The Third Blog</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">Jaz Worrell</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/12/T3B_2-10.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></a></figure>",

Research has drawn parallels between sleep deprivation and the effects of alcohol consumption, highlighting the serious consequences of inadequate rest.</p><ol><li><strong>Impact on Work Performance</strong>: <a href=\"https://hms.harvard.edu/news/showing-work-tired-just-showing-work-drunk\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Harvard Medical School research</a> indicates that the average American has lost about an hour and a half of sleep per night in recent decades. This loss of sleep has a substantial impact on workplace productivity and health, with insomnia alone costing an estimated $63 billion a year due to associated health and productivity issues\u200b\u200b.</li><li><strong>Cognitive Impairments</strong>: According to a study covered by ScienceAlert, lack of sleep leads to significant weakening in the brain's signaling network. This deterioration can cause memory lapses and concentration difficulties, similar to the effects of alcohol consumption. The study found that <a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/tiredness-sleep-deprivation-the-same-as-drinking-too-much\" rel=\"noreferrer\">sleep deprivation dampens brain cell activity</a>, causing slower neuron response, weaker firing, and prolonged transmission, akin to the mental state of a drunk driver\u200b\u200b.</li><li><strong>Moderate Sleep Deprivation and Alcohol Comparison</strong>: Well+Good highlights that even <a href=\"https://www.wellandgood.com/sleep-deprivation-affects-brain-the-same-as-alcohol-study/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">moderate sleep deprivation</a>, defined as getting less than seven hours of sleep per night, results in cognitive impairments similar to those caused by alcohol consumption. This state is not ideal for tasks requiring quick thinking or fast reactions. However, problem-solving tasks that require more effort and reasoning seem less affected by sleep deprivation\u200b\u200b.</li></ol><p>I don't know about you - but <strong>I don't want to work drunk</strong>. </p><h3 id=\"how-to-implement-sleep-simplexity-set-a-consistent-schedule\">How to implement sleep simplexity &amp; set a consistent schedule?</h3><ol><li><strong>Understand Your Sleep Pattern</strong>: Begin by acknowledging your current sleep habits. Identify what works and what doesn't. If you have a 'normal' job but go to bed past midnight everyday - <strong>you're sleep deprived</strong>. Find out how much sleep you need. Start with 9 hours and see how you feel.</li><li><strong>Set Small, Achievable Goals</strong>: As consistent sleep is the aim, start with minor adjustments. For instance, going to bed 15 minutes earlier than usual. If you need 9 hours of sleep, you need to be in bed around 9.5 hours before you wake up.</li><li><strong>Create a Relaxing Bedtime Routine</strong>: Simplify your pre-sleep activities. For me, I read, chat to my wife, clean the house a bit and listen to some 'sleep music' about an hour before bed. I also try to avoid any digital stimulation and intense exercise. (Although depending on my activity throughout the day, I will occasionally do some light, full body stretches)</li><li><strong>Track and Adjust</strong>: Keep a sleep diary or go digital. Note what improves your sleep and what hinders it. Adjust your routines accordingly. I mentioned Whoop before, but any sleep tracking device will do; Apple Watch, Fitbit, smart mattress etc. (<em>I've gone full circle and no longer track my sleep as I became obsessed with gamifying my metrics but this is extreme and won't happen to everyone</em>)</li><li><strong>Stay Consistent Yet Flexible</strong>: Aim for consistency but be adaptable. Life events might require adjustments to your sleep schedule. Don't beat yourself up about it But return to norm as soon as you can. If possible, stick to your schedule on weekends and you won\u2019t feel the need to sleep in and \u2018catchup\u2019 on lost rest. </li><li><strong>Seek Simplicity in Your Environment</strong>: Create a sleep-conducive environment. This can be as simple as dimming lights or reducing noise. Removing bedroom distractions and leaving your phone in another room. Don't overcomplicate and learn to catch yourself when breaking the rules. </li></ol><h2 id=\"enhancing-sleep-with-simplexity-expanded-strategies\"><strong>Enhancing Sleep with Simplexity: Expanded Strategies</strong></h2><p>As you know, this series is focused on the SIMPLE steps you can take to achieve results often clouded in complexity. If you do nothing else, I believe a consistent schedule will do the most for your mind and body - but there are also a host of other things you can try. If you want to take it to the \u2019next\u2018 level, you may consider some of the below. Regardless\u2026and as a small disclaimer - just listen to your body. </p><p>If you\u2019re tired. Go to sleep. </p><ol><li><strong>Temperature Control</strong>: Maintain a cool, comfortable temperature in your bedroom. Experiment to find the ideal temperature for your best sleep. (I use EIGHT SLEEP but it's expensive. It helped eliminate night sweats and keeps my body cold - which I love)</li><li><strong>BLUE Light &amp; Screen Time Reduction</strong>: Limit exposure to screens at least an hour before bed. The blue light from screens can disrupt your natural sleep cycle. (You may consider a dumb-phone after a certain hour or adjust your bulbs for a warmer light) <a href=\"https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/blue-light-filtering-lenses-dont-work\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Blue light blockers have also been debunked</a>. It\u2019s an easy trend to jump on but - don\u2019t waste your time or money with it. </li><li><strong>Sound &amp; Binaural Beats</strong>: Utilize calming sounds or binaural beats to create a soothing environment conducive to sleep. I use <a href=\"https://endel.io\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Endel</a> or YouTube.</li><li><strong>Blackout Curtains</strong>: Invest in blackout curtains to ensure your sleeping area is dark, aiding in deeper sleep. This is a great one. Your bedroom should be pitch black if possible.</li><li><strong>Sleeping Positions</strong>: Experiment with different sleeping positions to find the one that offers the most comfort and support for your body.</li><li><strong>Practice Relaxation Techniques</strong>: Techniques like meditation or deep breathing exercises can simplify the journey to sleep. Become aware of tense areas of the body. Often people will clench their jaw or have tight shoulders. I also found HUGE benefit in regular meditation to calm my racing thoughts - only problem was even after the major benefits, I stopped after 2 years. </li></ol><p>A <strong>Variation of F</strong> works the best for me as it keeps you still. The leg up and arm below pillow or by your side stops you fidgeting or moving around. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/01/sleeping-positions-template-1587725414.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/sleeping-positions-template-1587725414.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/sleeping-positions-template-1587725414.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/01/sleeping-positions-template-1587725414.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">8 sleeping positions and what they say about your personality - </span><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/lifestyle/a32251240/sleeping-positions/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Housebeautiful</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>I mentioned Brian Johnson at the start of this article.

Check it out:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A7seExq02H8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"The Disturbing Rise of iPad Kids\"></iframe></figure><p>The transformation of children into digital natives has been swift and profound. Tablets and smartphones, once hailed as educational tools, have now blurred the lines between learning and play, reality and virtuality. But as screens become the constant companions of our youngest generation, a troubling question arises: What are the implications of this digital immersion?</p><p><strong>Research sheds light on this issue, revealing a dual-edged sword</strong>. On one side, technology can be a potent educational tool, enhancing learning experiences with interactive apps and global connectivity. However, on the other, excessive screen time is linked to developmental delays, behavioral issues, and disrupted family dynamics.</p><blockquote>\"Gen Alpha \u2013 meaning anyone born between 2010 and 2024 \u2013 are defined and utterly subsumed by the digital world.\"  - VICE, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/contributor/eloise-hendy\">Eloise Hendy</a></blockquote><p>One of the most pressing concerns is the impact on developmental milestones. Studies indicate that children overly reliant on screens may experience <strong>delays in language development, shorter attention spans, and difficulties in emotional regulation</strong>. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limited screen time for children, emphasizing the importance of interactive, unstructured playtime for healthy development.</p><p><strong>Behavioural issues also come to the forefront</strong>. Parents and teachers report increased irritability, reduced patience, and a noticeable decline in physical activity among children who spend significant time on digital devices. The sedentary nature of screen time is at odds with the essential need for physical movement and exploration in a child's life.</p><p>The influence of screens extends beyond the individual child, reshaping family dynamics and interactions. Meals, once times for family conversations, are now often silent, with each member absorbed in their own digital world. This shift raises <strong>concerns about the long-term effects on communication skills</strong> and emotional bonding within families.</p><p>In navigating this digital landscape, parents face the task of setting boundaries. This can include designated 'screen-free' times, encouraging alternative hobbies like reading, sports, and arts, and using technology together as a family to promote shared experiences and learning. Who knows.</p><p>In conclusion, the rise of 'iPad Kids' presents a modern conundrum. While technology offers unprecedented opportunities for learning and growth, its overuse poses significant risks. </p><p>It is up to parents, educators, and society as a whole to <strong>guide this generation in balancing the digital and physical worlds</strong>, ensuring that the screens that open new horizons do not become barriers to the essential experiences of childhood.</p><p>Some food for thought. </p><p>Thanks for reading. </p><p>T3B</p>",

This inversion of conventional methods led to significantly improved results, underscoring the effectiveness of questioning and reversing standard practices. </p><p>His experience exemplifies how challenging the norm with an opposite mindset can unveil innovative solutions and strategies, perfectly aligning with Charlie Munger's philosophy of inversion.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-apply-inversion\"><strong>How to apply inversion:</strong></h3><div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-yellow\"><div class=\"kg-callout-emoji\">\ud83d\udca1</div><div class=\"kg-callout-text\">It can be very hard to explain the concept of '<i><em class=\"italic\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">invert, always invert</em></i>' without some examples, so here we go:</div></div><ol><li><strong>Product Development</strong>: Companies often focus on adding features to improve a product. Inverting this would mean asking, \"What could we remove from our product to make it better?\" This can lead to simplifying the product and improving user experience.</li><li><strong>Health and Fitness</strong>: In health, instead of asking, \"What can I do to be healthier?\" invert the question to, \"What habits should I stop or avoid to prevent being unhealthy?\" This can lead to identifying and eliminating harmful behaviors.</li><li><strong>Career Growth</strong>: Rather than thinking, \"What do I need to do to succeed in my career?\" consider, \"What are the mistakes or actions that could derail my career?\" This approach helps in avoiding pitfalls that could harm your professional progress.</li><li><strong>Time Management</strong>: Instead of trying to figure out how to do more things, ask yourself, \"What can I stop doing or do less of to free up more time?\" This can lead to more effective time management by eliminating non-essential activities.</li><li><strong>Relationships</strong>: In relationships, instead of thinking about what you can do to make a relationship better, consider what actions or behaviors might be damaging the relationship and should be stopped.</li><li><strong>Learning and Education</strong>: In learning, the question might be, \"What should I be studying?\" Inversion would have you ask, \"What are the areas where a lack of knowledge is holding me back the most?\" This can help prioritize learning efforts.</li><li><strong>Business Strategy</strong>: In business, instead of asking, \"How can we grow our market share?\" invert to ask, \"What are we doing that could cause us to lose market share?\" This helps in identifying and mitigating weaknesses in business strategy.</li><li><strong>Personal Happiness</strong>: Instead of asking, \"What makes me happy?\" consider inverting it to, \"What is making me unhappy?\" By identifying and addressing sources of unhappiness, overall well-being can be improved.</li></ol><h3 id=\"connecting-inversion-and-scaling-up\"><strong>Connecting Inversion and Scaling Up</strong></h3><p>Inversion is also crucial in scaling businesses. My previous blog on the '10x Rule' illustrates the significance of setting ambitious goals and scaling efforts accordingly. </p><p>Inversion complements this by helping identify and eliminate factors that hinder 10x growth.

This concept is about identifying and avoiding counterproductive habits and behaviours. </p><p>Instead of focusing solely on what you should be doing, pay attention to what you shouldn't be doing. By clearly defining these negative actions and consciously avoiding them, you can streamline your efforts, reduce inefficiencies, and enhance productivity. </p><p>This approach not only complements the inversion strategy but also offers a clear path to personal and professional improvement by eliminating distractions and focusing on what truly matters.</p><h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3><p>Munger\u2019s philosophy is a call to action to flip our perspective. </p><p>Inversion is a method of approaching problems in the opposite way. Perhaps even backward. Choosing to focusing on what to avoid before what to pursue. This approach not only offers you a new perspective on a given task, but also the opportunity to discover an alternative approach - perhaps a better one.</p><p>By inverting our approach, we unlock possibilities, finding solutions not in the direct path but often in the road less traveled. Combined with the principles of the '10x Rule', inversion becomes a powerful tool for achieving exponential growth and success.</p><p>See if you can incorporate inversion in your role today. </p><p>T3B</p>",

Although we don't always have influence over who we work with, we can be strategic in HOW we choose to work. Lets go:</p><h4 id=\"understand-the-law\">Understand the Law:</h4><p>Greene's Law 10 advises steering clear of those who are perpetually unhappy or unlucky. The rationale is that negativity and misfortune can be contagious, affecting your own outlook and success.</p><blockquote>\"There is nothing to be gained by associating with those who infect you with their negativity.

Deadlines create a sense of urgency and help maintain focus.</li><li><strong>Celebrate Small Wins</strong>: Acknowledge and celebrate the completion of each small goal. This reinforces positive feelings associated with task completion.</li><li><strong>Maintain Momentum</strong>: Use the momentum from each small achievement to propel you to the next goal.

Our smartphones buzz with notifications every other minute and our calendars are blocked out with back-to-back meetings. </p><p>The idea of being bored might seem like a distant memory. </p><p>But what if I told you that boredom, that seemingly unproductive state we all avoid, could be one of the keys to unlocking our creativity and improving our mental well-being?</p><h3 id=\"the-lost-art-of-doing-nothing\">The Lost Art of Doing Nothing</h3><p>Once upon a time, before the digital deluge, boredom was a common part of everyday life. People had moments of doing absolutely nothing - staring out of the window on a long train ride, waiting in a queue without the distraction of a mobile game, or simply sitting with their thoughts. These moments, devoid of any specific purpose or immediate gratification, were not just gaps in our day; they were the breeding ground for imagination and introspection.</p><p>This video is over 5 years old, but I found it a great, <em>quick</em> overview of this concept:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K710qprgtjo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"Why boredom is good for you - BBC REEL\"></iframe></figure><h3 id=\"the-overstimulated-mind\">The Overstimulated Mind</h3><p>Contrast that with today's reality. We live in a hyper-connected world where the idea of not doing something feels almost sinful. The moment we find ourselves with nothing to do, we reach for our phones, seeking that quick dopamine hit from a social media like or a news update. This constant stimulation has a cost - it deprives our minds of the opportunity to wander, to daydream, and to generate ideas organically.</p><h3 id=\"the-benefits-of-boredom\">The Benefits of Boredom</h3><p>Research suggests that boredom can foster creativity and problem-solving. </p><blockquote>When our minds are not actively engaged in a task, they wander, and this mind-wandering is a significant source of creative thinking. </blockquote><p>Boredom can also improve our mental health by allowing us to decompress and process our thoughts and experiences, leading to better self-reflection and understanding.</p><h3 id=\"embracing-boredom-in-a-busy-world\">Embracing Boredom in a Busy World</h3><p>So, how do we embrace boredom in a world that's constantly vying for our attention? Here are a few suggestions:</p><ol><li><strong>Digital Detox</strong>: Allocate certain times of the day or week where you consciously decide to stay away from digital devices. This could be during meals, the first hour after waking up, or right before bed.</li><li><strong>Mindful Waiting</strong>: Next time you're waiting in line or for an appointment, resist the urge to pull out your phone. Instead, observe your surroundings, let your thoughts wander, or simply be present in the moment.</li><li><strong>Scheduled Downtime</strong>: Block out time in your calendar for 'doing nothing.' Use this time to sit quietly, perhaps with a cup of tea, and let your mind roam free.</li><li><strong>Creative Outlets</strong>: Engage in activities that don\u2019t have a specific goal, like doodling, journaling, or walking without a destination. These activities provide a safe space for your mind to wander.</li></ol><p>In the relentless pursuit of productivity and efficiency, we've sidelined boredom, but it's time to reevaluate its role in our lives. I'm obsessed with productivity, but sometimes an unplanned moment of contemplation is better. </p><p>By welcoming moments of idleness, we open ourselves up to a world of creativity and self-discovery. So, the next time you find yourself with nothing to do, resist the urge to fill that space. Embrace the boredom, and let your mind take you on an unexpected journey.</p><p>Any plans for this weekend?</p><p>T3B</p>",

The finesse with which one handles relations at the workplace, manages stakeholders, and positions oneself amidst a network of power dynamics, often determines the trajectory of success. </p><p>Robert Greene, in his seminal work \"48 Laws of Power,\" elucidates this artistry in <strong>Law 24: Play the Perfect Courtier</strong>. This law, when applied judiciously in the business arena, can be a game-changer. </p><blockquote>\u201cThe perfect courtier thrives in a world where everything revolves around power and political dexterity. He has mastered the art of indirection; he flatters, yields to superiors, and asserts power over others in the most oblique and graceful manner.

In business, understanding and appreciating the stakeholders' perspectives, acknowledging their contributions, and making them feel valued can foster a conducive environment for collaboration and mutual growth. </p><blockquote>\"Be frugal with flattery, as excessive flattery will not only not be believed, but it will also provoke suspicion.\"</blockquote><p><strong>Maintain a Balanced Ego:</strong> It's crucial to strike a balance between confidence and humility. While it's essential to assert your ideas, being open to feedback and other perspectives reflects maturity and a collaborative spirit.</p><p><strong>Adaptability:</strong> A courtier is known for his adaptability. In a dynamic business landscape, being flexible and adaptable to change is a hallmark of a forward-thinking entrepreneur.</p><p><strong>Discreetness and Prudence:</strong> Exercise discretion in your dealings and communications. Being prudent with your words and actions ensures that you maintain a positive rapport and trust among your peers and superiors.</p><p><strong>Nonchalant Charm:</strong> A courtier's charm is effortless. Cultivate a persona that is approachable, amiable yet commanding respect and attention without appearing desperate or overbearing.</p><blockquote>\"Be self-observant, master your emotions, and always seem to be the one who brings out the good mood in the group.\"</blockquote><h3 id=\"applying-law-24-in-business-scenarios\">Applying Law 24 in Business Scenarios:</h3><p><strong>Networking:</strong> When networking, embody the grace and tact of a courtier.

Yet, the beauty of habits is that they can be molded, refined, and built upon.</p>\n<p>Habit stacking, is a term brought to the limelight by James Clear in \"Atomic Habits\". It isn't just about forming new habits, it's about creating powerful systems that enhance our daily lives. The premise is straightforward: you take a current habit and pair it with a new beneficial action. By doing this consistently, you build a robust system that can profoundly impact your life's trajectory.</p>\n<blockquote><strong>Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them</strong>. - Alfred North Whitehead</blockquote>\n<p>When you start habit stacking, something remarkable happens: these stacked habits begin to form interlinked systems that automate progress. For instance, suppose you've established a morning routine (a system) that includes making your bed, followed by ten minutes of meditation, and then writing for fifteen minutes. Each habit flows into the next, creating a predictable, efficient, and productive start to your day.</p>\n<p><strong>Consistency: The Ultimate Key to Achievement</strong></p>\n<p>Consistency is often the missing element between dreams and reality. By developing systems through habit stacking, you automatically instill consistency into your life. Consider the dream of writing a book. It can seem daunting when viewed as a singular colossal task. But break it down into a system \u2014 writing just one page daily \u2014 and in a year, you'll have a 365-page manuscript. That's the power of consistency through systems.</p>\n<p>With the consistency that habit-stacked systems offer, seemingly insurmountable goals become attainable. Want to learn a new language? A system of daily vocabulary acquisition and practice can make you fluent over time. Dream of running a marathon? A structured training system, built upon daily small runs and gradual increases, will get you across that finish line.</p>\n<p><strong>The Myth of 100% Consistency:</strong></p>\n<p>First and foremost, let\u2019s debunk a prevalent myth: consistency isn't ache ivng 100% every single day. It means doing your best, whatever that might be on any given day. Some days, your best might be scribbling a few lines for your book or drafting a brief outline for a blog post. On other days, it could mean writing multiple chapters or several articles. The key is to keep moving, to keep pushing, irrespective of the scale.</p>\n<p>As the philosopher Alain de Botton once remarked:</p>\n<blockquote>\u201cAnyone who isn\u2019t embarrassed by who they were last year probably isn\u2019t learning enough.\u201d </blockquote>\n<p>Growth is an evolving process, and our \u2018best\u2019 today might seem inadequate tomorrow. That\u2019s not inconsistency; that\u2019s progress.</p>\n<p>Habit stacking isn't merely about tacking on new habits to existing ones. It's about understanding the profound impact of systems in our lives. When we consciously build and refine these systems, we set ourselves on a path of consistent progress, turning the impossible into the achievable. </p>\n<p>T3B</p>",

Most people are vying for a spot in the limelight and their techniques are pretty much the same.</p>\n<p>A simple principle can help you leapfrog from mediocrity to extraordinary: the \"10x Rule.\" </p>\n<p>Conceived by Grant Cardone, this philosophy urges a <strong>tenfold surge in thinking and doing</strong>. </p>\n<blockquote>\"Average is a failing plan! Average doesn't work in any area of life. Anything that you give only average amounts of attention to will start to subside and will eventually cease to exist.\" - Grant Cardone</blockquote>\n<p>At the crux of Cardone's philosophy is not just the idea of increasing effort but magnifying vision and ambition. It\u2019s about aiming higher than the highest and working harder than the hardest.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://cardonezone.libsyn.com/time-how-to-10x-your-hours-cardone-zone-ep-183\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">The Cardone Zone: Time, How to 10x Your Hours | Cardone Zone Ep. 183</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">On today\u2019s episode&amp;nbsp;of the Cardone&amp;nbsp;Zone, Grant Cardone exposes a problem that&amp;nbsp;has been with us since the beginning&amp;nbsp;of civilization the procrastination and time management dilemma.

The Trap of Premature Quitting:</strong> Most people don't fail because they lack ability or opportunity; they fail because they don't persist long enough. Cardone's 10x Rule addresses this, emphasizing that consistent, magnified effort is the path to quality results. </p>\n<p>Many abandon their endeavors just when they're on the cusp of a breakthrough. In a society that seeks instant gratification, the 10x Rule is a reminder that real success often demands prolonged effort. Not seeing the success you want in your blog after 10 posts? - Try 500 posts instead.</p>\n<p>Not seeing the results from your new instagram page after 100 posts? - Stop playing in the amateur leagues and produce 1000.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Execution Over Eloquence:</strong> Ideas are a dime a dozen, but what sets the 10x doers apart is their unwavering commitment to execution. While many get trapped in the cycle of perpetual planning and endless talking, 10x achievers focus on doing. </p>\n<p>There is huge benefit in actually getting things done. In business, these people are few and far between. Even if you don't 10x, just focusing on this will set you apart. Do what you say you're going to do, then do more. ;) </p>\n<p><strong>3. The Power of Iteration:</strong> In tandem with execution is the principle of iteration. A 10x mindset isn't about getting it perfect the first time; it's about continuous refinement. By constantly iterating on ideas, strategies, or products, you not only adapt to an ever-evolving world but often end up pioneering change.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Standing Out in a Sea of Sameness:</strong> Whether it's business, art, sports, or any field, the 10x Rule is a surefire way to distinguish yourself. When you operate at 10x, you're not just another player; you become the game-changer. In a world filled with noise, 10x is your unique signal, your clarion call that demands attention.</p>\n<p>Think about that!</p>\n<p>T3B</p>",

The dreaded red ink, highlighting every error and oversight, can inadvertently overshadow a student's hard work. </p>\n<p>Enter the \"Green Pen Effect\"\u2014a shift in approach that emphasizes growth, positivity, and forward momentum. Let's dive into this transformative concept and understand its profound impact on the learning journey.</p>\n<p>For decades, the red pen has been the emblematic tool of teachers and professors, marking errors with stark clarity. But the unintended consequence? A color that often signifies danger or stop in many cultures can potentially send an unintended message of failure. For learners, this might inadvertently focus their attention on what they did wrong, rather than what they could do right in the future.</p>\n<p>The Green Pen Effect flips this narrative. By marking with green\u2014a color universally associated with growth, go, and positivity\u2014educators subtly shift the focus. Instead of a glaring spotlight on mistakes, the green pen feels like a gentle nudge towards improvement. It's a shift from \"You did this wrong\" to \"Here's how you can grow.\"</p>\n<p>In the digital age, where feedback is instantaneous and often impersonal, the psychological nuances of something as simple as color become even more crucial. A study, for instance, might reveal that students receiving feedback in green ink are more likely to engage with the corrections positively, seeing them as opportunities for growth rather than as critiques.</p>\n<p>Brands and companies have long harnessed the power of color psychology\u2014blue for trust, yellow for optimism. In education, the Green Pen Effect embodies a similar principle. It\u2019s not merely about changing the color of ink but transforming the very essence of feedback into a tool for growth.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/09/color-psychology-meanings-usage-feature-image.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"840\" height=\"448\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/color-psychology-meanings-usage-feature-image.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/09/color-psychology-meanings-usage-feature-image.jpg 840w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span>Digital Synopsis - </span><a href=\"https://digitalsynopsis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/color-psychology-meanings-usage-feature-image.jpg\"><span>https://digitalsynopsis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/color-psychology-meanings-usage-feature-image.jpg</span></a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>For educators, adopting the Green Pen Effect could be a step towards cultivating a growth mindset in students. For learners, it's a gentle reminder that feedback, even when pointing out mistakes, is rooted in the intent of fostering growth and development.</p>\n<p>So, the color of feedback\u2014whether in education, work, or personal relationships\u2014plays a pivotal role in how it's received. The Green Pen Effect serves as a testament to the profound impact of small changes. As we navigate the realm of teaching and learning, it's worth pondering: Are we highlighting errors or illuminating paths to growth?</p>\n<p>T3B</p>",

      "content_html": "<p>In a world inundated with content, products, and ideas, how does one discern the exceptional from the mediocre? </p><p>Enter <strong>Sturgeon's Law</strong>. This seemingly simple adage holds profound insights into the nature of quality and value, stating: </p><blockquote>\"Ninety percent of everything is crap.\" </blockquote><p><strong>But before this leaves you feeling pessimistic</strong>, let's delve deeper into this principle and discover its liberating clarity in a world of overwhelming choices.</p><h3 id=\"the-origins\">The Origins</h3><p>The origins of Sturgeon's Law trace back to science fiction author Theodore Sturgeon. Faced with criticism that most science fiction was of poor quality, he astutely responded that 90% of everything, not just sci-fi, is crap. His observation was less about dismissing entire genres or mediums but emphasising that true gems are, and always have been, a minority.</p><h3 id=\"the-problem\">The Problem</h3><p>In our digital age, with the constant barrage of social media posts, online articles, and endless products vying for our attention, Sturgeon's insight is more relevant than ever. The overwhelming majority might indeed be mediocre, but that elusive 10%? It's worth our time, energy, and appreciation.</p><p>Consider your favorite streaming platform like Netflix. Thousands of shows and movies are at your fingertips, but how many truly captivate? How often anre you scrolling for something to watch rather than watching. </p><p>All the movies released nowadays are garbage. They have the same plots, same characters and everything is so predictable - it\u2019s hard to be believe people get paid to regurgitate the same thing over and over again. </p><p>Or think about the countless startups emerging daily; only a handful might revolutionize industries. This isn't cynicism but rather an empowering realisation: in recognising that most will be 'crap,' we can fine-tune our radar for the truly remarkable.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/12/Chesterton-s-Fence.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1118\" height=\"842\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Chesterton-s-Fence.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Chesterton-s-Fence.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/12/Chesterton-s-Fence.jpg 1118w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Sturgeon's Law - 90% of everything is crap.</span></figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"challenge-vs-opportunity\">Challenge vs. Opportunity</h3><p>For brands and creators, Sturgeon's Law offers both a challenge and an opportunity. </p><p><strong>The challenge? </strong></p><p>Strive to be in that top 10%, where quality reigns supreme. </p><p><strong>The opportunity? </strong></p><p>In a saturated market, excellence stands out and is remembered. Being in that 10% can spell the difference between obscurity and lasting impact.</p><p>But what about us, the consumers and appreciators? Sturgeon's Law serves as a reminder. It tells us to be patient, to sift through the noise, and to <strong>value the exceptional when we find it</strong>. </p><p>It asks us to celebrate quality over quantity, recognizing that true brilliance is a rare commodity.

Brands clamor for attention, pushing out ads, campaigns, and content, often accompanied by behind-the-scenes reels and exhaustive narratives of the efforts undertaken. But does this approach always resonate with the audience? Does showcasing effort always equate to appreciation or can it sometimes lead to fatigue?</p><p>Robert Greene introduces a counterintuitive strategy. By making your accomplishments appear effortless, you create an aura of mystique and superiority. The less the audience knows about the struggles, the challenges, and the sweat, the more they're drawn to the enigma of your success.</p><p>Consider Apple, a behemoth in the tech industry. Their product launches, while intricately planned and executed, are presented with a sheen of simplicity. The sleek design, the seamless interface, the effortless integration of technology \u2013 all are displayed as if they just... happened. Yet, we know the monumental efforts behind them. This strategy positions Apple as a brand operating on another level, a realm where they effortlessly churn out innovations, making competitors appear clumsy in their attempts.</p><p>From a marketing perspective, there\u2019s brilliance in this approach. When you portray your brand or product as effortlessly superior, you tap into the consumers' desire for the best without the associated drama. It creates an allure, an irresistible pull. Customers aspire to align with brands that epitomize ease and excellence, thinking perhaps that the products will impart a bit of that effortless magic into their own lives.</p><p>However, a word of caution: Effortlessness should never equate to complacency. The aim is to work diligently, perfect the product, strategize the campaign, but present it with an aura of simplicity.</p><p>So, next time you're crafting a marketing campaign or launching a product, channel Robert Greene\u2019s wisdom. Make it grand, but make it appear effortless. </p><p>In the game of perceptions, sometimes what's left unseen has the greatest power. The magic lies not in showcasing the hustle but in presenting the masterpiece as if it were the natural order of things.</p><p>To truly dominate the market, let\u2019s endeavor to combine hard work with the art of effortless presentation. Let the world be enchanted by the result, while the process remains our well-guarded secret.</p><p>T3B</p>",

      "content_html": "<p>There's a deep-rooted desire in each one of us to be seen, to be acknowledged, to be rewarded. It's as though our actions, no matter how genuine, always crave an audience. This longing for recognition, for that proverbial pat on the back, is what Marcus Aurelius refers to as \"the third thing\" in his philosophical musings. Let\u2019s delve deeper into this concept and understand why it\u2019s so resonant even today.</p>\n<p>We live in a world where \"likes\", \"shares\", and \"comments\" often validate our existence. Every picture posted, every story shared seems incomplete without the ensuing validation. It begs the question, why do we seek this \u201cthird thing\u201d? Why isn't the act itself or the inherent goodness of it enough?</p>\n<p>Marcus Aurelius asks a compelling question: If the deed has been done and someone has benefited from it, why then do we still hunger for something more? Is the mere act of goodness insufficient to satiate our souls?</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Did you leave a big tip to that waitress or driver who was clearly struggling so they\u2019d run out and thank you\u2014or did you do it because you knew that it was right?</em>\u201d - The Daily Stoic, <a href=\"https://dailystoic.com/you-do-not-need-this/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">You do not need this</a>.</p>\n<p>The truth is, at some level, our societal conditioning has intertwined our self-worth with external validation. The good we do feels magnified when it\u2019s seen, acknowledged, and appreciated by others. But, as Marcus Aurelius suggests, this relentless pursuit of the \u201cthird thing\u201d can be a fool's errand.</p>\n<p>Imagine a world where goodness is its own reward, where the act is complete in itself without the need for external affirmation. Such a world would free us from the shackles of incessant validation and allow us to live more authentically.</p>\n<p>So, next time you find yourself seeking that \u201cthank you\u201d or that nod of appreciation, remind yourself of Marcus Aurelius\u2019 wisdom. Question the roots of this need and contemplate on the purity of the act itself. Maybe, just maybe, you'll find that the joy derived from the act is enough, and the \u201cthird thing\u201d is merely a superfluous addition to an already complete equation.</p>\n<p>In the end, let\u2019s strive to do good, not because the world will see, but because it\u2019s intrinsically rewarding. Let\u2019s challenge ourselves to be content with the first two things \u2013 the act and its impact \u2013 and let go of the elusive \u201cthird thing\u201d.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading.</p>\n<p>T3B</p>",

      "content_html": "<p>Sitting on my balcony with a freshly brewed coffee in hand, I found myself lost in thought after stumbling upon a quote by Robert Greene: </p>\n<blockquote>\"Do not build fortresses, isolation is dangerous.\" </blockquote>\n<p>The words resonated, echoing sentiments I'd been grappling with in the age of remote work.</p>\n<p>The shift to working from home was, for many of us, a welcome reprieve. The daily grind of commutes became a distant memory, replaced by the comfort of our own spaces. Our homes, once just a place of rest, transformed into fortresses of productivity. These fortresses, tailored to our every need, shielded us from the outside world, offering a sanctuary where work and rest coexisted.</p>\n<p>I am a solid supporter of working from home. Throughout the lockdown I had multiple jobs that allowed me to 3x my income - something that would have been impossible from the office. I am comfortable, have my own food and can accommodate my energy levels throughout the day. I have trouble sleeping so sometimes I would work from 4am - 10am, then be able to 'relax' for much of the afternoon. My work would always be done, but this kind of flexibility is never possible in an office. </p>\n<p>I've never agreed with the 'work culture' is important statement. I think it is mostly BS to gain control over peoples working day and working hours. It's an old adage that longer hours, mean more productive work. I've done this. I would sit in an office - first to arrive and last to leave for years to signal to management that I was the hardest worker in the room. It worked for my progression, but as you age, priorities change.</p>\n<p>Even schemes such as 'bring your dog to work' or onsite restaurants are all schemes to keep you in the office longer. If I don't have to go home to walk my dog, or to cook dinner - I can keep working in the office. Madness.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/09/146-work-from-home-diagram-02-1024x785.png.webp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"785\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/146-work-from-home-diagram-02-1024x785.png.webp 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/146-work-from-home-diagram-02-1024x785.png.webp 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/09/146-work-from-home-diagram-02-1024x785.png.webp 1024w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure>\n<p>Unlike many, working in solitude is great for me. I do my best work when I can manage my own time and my hours. Social interactions are not something I crave, but I understand the fundamental human need for it. I run big teams and we've all found ways to adapt to the communication needs of a large department. There are many benefits, however it's not for everyone. One thing I've come to realise from Robert Greene is that you don't want to fall into the trap of thinking that independence is the ultimate form of power. You need people and being isolated (such as from a home office) makes you a target.</p>\n<p>Greene's 18th Law from \"The 48 Laws of Power\" delves into this very sentiment, warning of the dangers of shutting oneself away. It speaks to the essence of being present in the world, of engaging with its ever-evolving rhythm. In the realm of work, it's a poignant reminder. While our fortresses\u2014our home offices, our balconies, our quiet nooks\u2014offer solace and focus, they might also inadvertently distance us from the camaraderie and office politics that happens face-to-face. It's all part of a larger 'show' - but a needed one to navigate the 'game of work'.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it's time to reevaluate. Not to abandon the fortress entirely, but to occasionally step beyond its walls. To find a balance between the solitude that fosters deep work and the communal spaces that ignite collaboration and provide opportunities to gain power. It's not about reverting to the old ways but finding harmony in the new.</p>\n<p>The future of work, much like this morning's brew, is about finding the right blend\u2014a mix of solitude and togetherness, of fortresses and open spaces. Although remote work has been working VERY Well for me over the past 2/3 years - change is always good and welcomed. </p>\n<p>Some food for thought. </p>\n<p>T3B</p>",

It's not about the numbers, the likes, or the retweets. It's about authenticity, patience, and mutual growth.</p>\n<p>We've all been there\u2014sending a DM to someone we admire, hoping for a response. But as Justin points out, the typical \"brain pick\" approach is not only ineffective but also overwhelming for those on the receiving end. Imagine having thousands of such requests; it's simply not feasible to address them all.</p>\n<p>Instead, the key lies in <strong>mutual value</strong>. It's not about what you can extract from the relationship, but what you can contribute. This mindset shift, from taking to giving, is transformative. Whether it's sharing their content, introducing them to a valuable contact, or even just offering genuine feedback, these small gestures can lay the foundation for a lasting relationship.</p>\n<blockquote><em>[T]he only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.</em> - Dale Carnegie</blockquote>\n<p>Your digital footprint, your social media profile, is your introduction. As Justin suggests, it should be clear, compelling, and reflective of who you are. It's your chance to make a memorable first impression. Ask yourself, if someone stumbled upon your profile, would they be intrigued enough to engage? Would they even know what it is you do?</p>\n<p>On a personal level, the only social media I have is LinkedIn. I got rid of all my accounts about 6/7 years ago after I caught myself doom-scrolling and wasting countless hours a day. Self promotion is very foreign to me but after reading 'The Laws of Power', it's important to reinvent yourself every now and then and move with the times.</p>\n<blockquote><strong>Robert Greene</strong> has a fantastic quote where he says: \"<em>I don\u2019t want to be in the position, which is a mistake many people make in life, of constantly repeating the same success formula. Part 2 etc. Change things up, enter action with boldness, don\u2019t be afraid to do things differently, adapt your strategy to circumstance</em>.\"</blockquote>\n<p>As a result of this. I've recently considered some form of social media to promote myself, my skills, my interests and my hobbies. This blog is a nice start, but maybe I can do more.</p>\n<p>In the world of marketing, where relationships are the backbone of success, these insights are invaluable. It's a reminder that behind every screen is a human, with aspirations, challenges, and stories. By approaching each interaction with empathy, authenticity, and a genuine desire to add value, we can forge connections that go beyond the digital realm.</p>\n<p>In essence, as we navigate the intricate world of social media, let's remember Justin's wisdom. Let's be genuine, offer value, and most importantly, be patient. Because true relationships, whether online or offline, are not built in a day. They're nurtured over time, with care, understanding, and mutual respect.</p>\n<p>T3B</p>",

These skirmishes, whether they be personal, professional, or emotional, consume our thoughts and dictate our actions. </p><p>Robert Greene, in his book \"The 33 Strategies of War,\" aptly observes: </p><blockquote>\u201c<em>Most of us in life are tacticians, not strategists. We become so enmeshed in the conflicts we face that we can think only of how to get what we want in the battle we are currently facing.</em>\u201d</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/12/Chesterton-s-Fence-8.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1118\" height=\"842\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Chesterton-s-Fence-8.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Chesterton-s-Fence-8.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/12/Chesterton-s-Fence-8.jpg 1118w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">\u201c</span><i><em class=\"italic\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Most of us in life are tacticians, not strategists\" - Robert Greene, </em></i><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">The 33 Strategies of War</span></figcaption></figure><p>As you can see from the rest of my content, I'm a big fan of the work from <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/tag/robert-greene/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Robert Greene</a>. Normally we talk about 'Power', but this time it's War.</p><h3 id=\"the-tacticians-dilemma\">The Tactician's Dilemma</h3><p>Tacticians are reactive. They respond to immediate challenges, often with great skill and precision. Think of them as the firefighters of life, always ready to douse the flames of the latest crisis. While this approach has its merits, especially in high-pressure situations, it can also be limiting. By focusing solely on the present, tacticians may miss the broader picture, sacrificing long-term gains for short-term victories.</p><p>In our digital age, where instant gratification is the norm, it's easy to fall into the tactician's trap. We're constantly bombarded with notifications, messages, and updates, pulling our attention in a million different directions. This \"<a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/tame-your-digital-monkey-conquer-your-primal-brain-and-reclaim-your-digital-life/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">digital monkey</a>\" we grapple with daily can make it challenging to see beyond the immediate.</p><p>For all my life I've been an accomplished tactician, however this made me open my eyes to strategically planning for the future. For example, I've practised martial arts all my life - however as I age I'll need to pick one where I can remain competitive and keep learning. MMA is not a good option, but perhaps BJJ is. </p><p>No doubt you've heard the quote: </p><blockquote>\u201cIf you fail to plan, you plan to fail\u201d -&nbsp;Benjamin Franklin. </blockquote><p>This can be applied everywhere.</p><h3 id=\"the-strategists-vision\">The Strategist's Vision</h3><p>On the other hand, strategists are forward-thinkers. They see the bigger picture, planning several moves ahead. Instead of merely reacting to challenges, they anticipate them, devising plans to navigate obstacles and seize opportunities. Strategists understand that today's decisions have ramifications for the future. They recognize the interconnectedness of life's battles and strive to align their actions with their long-term goals.</p><p>Consider the concept of \"<a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/the-riddle-of-chestertons-fence/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chesterton's Fence</a>\" which I've written about previously. Before making changes, it's essential to understand the purpose of existing systems. This mindset is emblematic of a strategist, who seeks to comprehend the broader context before taking action.</p><h3 id=\"bridging-the-gap\">Bridging the Gap</h3><p>So, how can we transition from tacticians to strategists in our lives? The key lies in self-awareness and reflection. By regularly taking a step back to assess our actions and their implications, we can start to see the broader picture. It's about questioning our motivations, understanding our goals, and aligning our actions accordingly.</p><p>Moreover, embracing practices like Stoicism, could provide valuable tools for this transition. By focusing on what's within our control and accepting what's not, we can cultivate a strategic mindset, ensuring that our actions today serve our greater purpose tomorrow.</p><p>Life will always present us with battles. The choice between being a tactician or a strategist is ours to make. While there's a time and place for both approaches, cultivating a strategic mindset can provide clarity, purpose, and direction in our increasingly chaotic world.</p><p>Here's a nice video from Patrick Bet David that supplements this message:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jKQ7uOd0U_M?start=247&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"Think Like A Grand Master Entrepreneur- 2019 Driven Keynote\"></iframe></figure><p>T3B</p>",

This ancient part of our psyche jumps from thought to thought, craves instant gratification, and gets easily distracted\u2014much like a curious, impulsive monkey. Similarly, in the sprawling digital jungle, we find ourselves easily lost and overwhelmed, our attention snagged at every turn by the shiny, new, and immediate. This is your digital monkey, and it's time to tame it. With Digital Monkey, you will discover how to harness this monkey mind within your digital landscape, reclaim your attention, and make technology work for you.</p><h2 id=\"unchain-your-digital-monkey\">Unchain Your Digital Monkey</h2><p>First, we must understand our monkey brain's tendency to be captivated by the instant and ever-changing \u2013 much like the lure of social media feeds or notification pings. To begin taming your digital monkey, declutter your devices, removing apps that feed this primal impulse for ceaseless novelty and distraction.</p><h2 id=\"taming-techniques-tips-to-control-your-digital-monkey\">Taming Techniques: Tips to Control Your Digital Monkey</h2><p>Each of these tips is a step towards transforming your relationship with technology, enabling you to make more intentional, beneficial choices and better harness the advantages of your digital tools.</p><p><strong>Notification Taming</strong>: Notifications are like fruits that attract your digital monkey. But too many fruits can lead to a chaotic, distraction-laden digital experience. Take charge and decide which notifications truly need your immediate attention, and disable the rest. This will significantly reduce interruptions, helping you maintain focus and productivity.</p><p><strong>One of Each</strong>: Multiple apps for the same purpose create confusion and chaos. Keep one app for each function\u2014 one calendar, one to-do list, and one email app. Consistency simplifies decision-making and streamlines your digital life.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/07/2.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1118\" height=\"842\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/2.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/2.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/07/2.jpg 1118w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Tame Your Digital Monkey - The Third Blog</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Device Simplification</strong>: Each device should serve a clear purpose. Overloading your devices with numerous features and apps can be overwhelming and lead to unnecessary distractions. Stick to essential features and remember that not every device needs to do everything.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-green\"><div class=\"kg-callout-emoji\">\ud83d\udca1</div><div class=\"kg-callout-text\">I had email alerts enabled on my iPhone, iWatch and iPad. It's too much. Decide what each device is for and simplify both the use and output.</div></div><p><strong>Efficient Typing</strong>: A major time-saver and a fundamental skill in our digital age, touch typing lets you navigate your digital world at speed. Say goodbye to the slow, error-prone pecking and welcome the seamless flow of words from your fingertips. There are various online courses and tools that can help you master this invaluable skill.</p><p><strong>Password Manager</strong>: In the sprawling digital jungle, your monkey brain struggles to remember the login details for each account. A password manager is a lifesaver here, storing your passwords securely and auto-filling them when needed. It's like having a reliable guide in the jungle, always keeping you on track.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-green\"><div class=\"kg-callout-emoji\">\ud83d\udca1</div><div class=\"kg-callout-text\">Now 2FA (2-factor authentication) is seemingly everywhere - why have yet another app when it can all be automated in one? We have so many passwords nowadays; from pin codes to website logins - make it easier for yourself!</div></div><p><strong>Mono-tasking</strong>: Multitasking is a trap for the monkey brain, leading to mistakes, decreased productivity, and increased stress. There is SO much science around this. Prioritize mono-tasking, focusing on one task at a time. You'll find your work becomes more mindful and your productivity increases significantly.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/07/arcturixx_monkey_with_VR_goggles_entering_a_password_colourful__b59ffed4-79e1-4f99-8ae4-8df79cc17de4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"842\" height=\"634\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/arcturixx_monkey_with_VR_goggles_entering_a_password_colourful__b59ffed4-79e1-4f99-8ae4-8df79cc17de4.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/07/arcturixx_monkey_with_VR_goggles_entering_a_password_colourful__b59ffed4-79e1-4f99-8ae4-8df79cc17de4.png 842w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><strong>Automation</strong>: Use the magic of automation to make repetitive tasks disappear, letting technology work for you while you focus on more important things. Automate email filtering, finance tracking, even meeting scheduling to stop that awful back and forth.</p><p><strong>Focus Modes</strong>: Creating separate spaces for work and personal activities can do wonders for your productivity and work-life balance. Differentiate these spaces digitally too. Customize your device home screens for work and personal use, so you're not tempted to mix the two.</p><p><strong>Mass Unsubscribe</strong>: Are you subscribed to too many newsletters, leaving your inbox cluttered and your mind overwhelmed? Be ruthless and unsubscribe from anything that doesn't bring value to your life. Keep the monkey's curiosity at bay and clear the path for what really matters.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-green\"><div class=\"kg-callout-emoji\">\ud83d\udca1</div><div class=\"kg-callout-text\">I also set a filter to remove anything with the word 'unsubscribe' straight to my archive.

Regularly review and remove these. A leaner, cleaner digital space awaits.</p><p><strong>Create &gt; Consume</strong>: Encourage your digital monkey to craft, not just consume. Spend more time producing content, learning new skills, or working on personal projects. Active engagement is more rewarding and fulfilling.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/07/3.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1118\" height=\"842\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/3.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/3.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/07/3.jpg 1118w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Optimise Your Digital Monkey - The Third Blog</span></figcaption></figure><div class=\"kg-card kg-audio-card\"><img src=\"\" alt=\"audio-thumbnail\" class=\"kg-audio-thumbnail kg-audio-hide\"><div class=\"kg-audio-thumbnail placeholder\"><svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" fill=\"none\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M7.5 15.33a.75.75 0 1 0 0 1.5.75.75 0 0 0 0-1.5Zm-2.25.75a2.25 2.25 0 1 1 4.5 0 2.25 2.25 0 0 1-4.5 0ZM15 13.83a.75.75 0 1 0 0 1.5.75.75 0 0 0 0-1.5Zm-2.25.75a2.25 2.25 0 1 1 4.5 0 2.25 2.25 0 0 1-4.5 0Z\"></path><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M14.486 6.81A2.25 2.25 0 0 1 17.25 9v5.579a.75.75 0 0 1-1.5 0v-5.58a.75.75 0 0 0-.932-.727.755.755 0 0 1-.059.013l-4.465.744a.75.75 0 0 0-.544.72v6.33a.75.75 0 0 1-1.5 0v-6.33a2.25 2.25 0 0 1 1.763-2.194l4.473-.746Z\"></path><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M3 1.5a.75.75 0 0 0-.75.75v19.5a.75.75 0 0 0 .75.75h18a.75.75 0 0 0 .75-.75V5.133a.75.75 0 0 0-.225-.535l-.002-.002-3-2.883A.75.75 0 0 0 18 1.5H3ZM1.409.659A2.25 2.25 0 0 1 3 0h15a2.25 2.25 0 0 1 1.568.637l.003.002 3 2.883a2.25 2.25 0 0 1 .679 1.61V21.75A2.25 2.25 0 0 1 21 24H3a2.25 2.25 0 0 1-2.25-2.25V2.25c0-.597.237-1.169.659-1.591Z\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"kg-audio-player-container\"><audio src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/media/2023/07/synthesized_audio--2-.mp3\" preload=\"metadata\"></audio><div class=\"kg-audio-title\">Tame Your Digital Monkey.

      "content_html": "<p>In the journey of personal and career growth, a pivotal yet often overlooked skill is <strong>the ability to ask strategic questions</strong>. This is especially true in the dynamic world of marketing, where understanding broader contexts and exhibiting strategic insight are as crucial as hands-on task execution.</p>\n<p><strong>Questions serve a greater purpose than just seeking immediate answers</strong>. They are a strategic tool that can provoke a deeper understanding, foster open dialogue, unveil opportunities, and stimulate innovation. </p>\n<p>Well-crafted questions can help to clarify objectives, dissect processes, identify gaps, and lead to more informed decision-making. <strong>Moreover, the types of questions you pose can serve as a snapshot of your perspective, strategic thinking ability, and potential for leadership</strong>.</p>\n<!--members-only-->\n<h3 id=\"questions-reflect-your-role-and-perspective\"><strong>Questions Reflect Your Role and Perspective</strong></h3>\n<p>An intern may ask, \"What is our main marketing goal for this campaign?\" reflecting a desire to understand their task's purpose. A marketing director, on the other hand, might ask, \"How can we align our marketing strategy with the company's overall business goals?\" This question indicates a higher-level perspective, considering the company's broader objectives and strategic alignment.</p>\n<p>The questions asked at each level align with the responsibilities of the role. Lower-level roles often focus on immediate tasks and outputs, while senior positions require strategic thought and an eye on the big picture.</p>\n<p>Imagine you start asking questions that reflect the considerations of a role one or two steps ahead of yours. This doesn't mean you disregard your current responsibilities. Instead, it means you're actively seeking to understand your role within a larger context, demonstrating your readiness for growth and increased responsibility.</p>\n<p>Cultivating a culture of curiosity is a key driver for businesses to thrive in a competitive market. When employees at all levels feel encouraged to ask questions 'above' their role, doors open to innovation, improved processes, and better business outcomes.</p>\n<p>The questions you ask <em>could</em> significantly influence your career progression. </p>\n<p>As such, <strong>it's crucial to elevate the nature of your questions as you ascend in your role</strong>. This practice signals your readiness for higher responsibilities, contributes to your personal development, and broadens your perspective of the organization.</p>\n<p>For a long time i've considered turning this topic into a book of its own. </p>\n<p>There is so much to unpack. </p>\n<p>Over the years, I've witnessed how strategic questions can change people's perceptions in seconds. <strong>Asking the right questions can make people stop, think and ponder</strong>. </p>\n<p>Here are some role-specific questions you can use as a starting point. Bear in mind, the examples below are based on a very hierarchical leadership structure:</p>\n<p><strong>Marketing Intern</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>What is our main marketing goal for this campaign?</li><li>How do we measure the success of our campaigns?</li><li>Who is our target audience for this particular product or service?</li><li>How can I assist in executing the marketing strategy effectively?</li><li>Can you explain how our marketing strategy aligns with the company\u2019s overall business strategy?</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Marketing Coordinator / Assistant</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>How does our marketing strategy differ between our various products or services?</li><li>What metrics should I focus on in my reports?</li><li>What strategies have been most effective in reaching our target audience?</li><li>Can you provide more context about how our marketing efforts directly influence sales?</li><li>How does our social media strategy fit into the overall marketing plan?</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Marketing Manager</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>What's the long-term vision for our marketing efforts?</li><li>How does our budget allocation across various channels reflect our strategic priorities?</li><li>What\u2019s the ROI for our different marketing campaigns?</li><li>How are we keeping pace with changes in our industry and marketing trends?</li><li>How can we improve our team\u2019s collaboration with sales, product, and other teams?</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Director of Marketing</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>How can we further align our marketing strategy with the company's business goals?</li><li>What are the key marketing trends we should capitalize on?</li><li>What are the gaps in our current marketing strategy and how can we address them?</li><li>How can we improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing team?</li><li>How do we foster a culture of innovation and creativity within our team?</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Vice President of Marketing</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>How should we adjust our strategy to meet changing market conditions or competitive landscape?</li><li>How can we use data and analytics more effectively to inform our decisions?</li><li>How do we maintain brand consistency across all channels and touchpoints?</li><li>How can we better understand our customer journey to improve our marketing efforts?</li><li>What's our plan for talent development within the marketing team?</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Chief Marketing Officer (CMO)</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>How does our marketing strategy support our business strategy over the next 1-3 years?</li><li>Are there opportunities for strategic partnerships or collaborations to boost our marketing efforts?</li><li>How can we leverage new technologies or approaches to stay ahead of competitors?</li><li>How can we create a customer-centric culture throughout the organization?</li><li>What's our contingency plan if our current marketing strategy doesn't deliver the expected results?</li></ul>\n<p>Keep in mind, these questions are just examples and should be adjusted to reflect the specifics of your company, industry, and current business environment.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this is food for thought.</p>\n<p>T3B</p>",

Data, the unseen superhero of our era, is transforming the way we do business, especially in the realm of marketing. But, as we'll explore, it's not just about collecting data and admiring fancy dashboards. It's about taking action because, after all, <strong>actions speak louder than dashboards</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-power-of-data\">The Power of Data</h3>\n<p>According to a report by McKinsey Global Institute, the potential of big data just keeps growing. The volume of data doubles every three years, thanks to digital platforms, wireless sensors, virtual-reality applications, and billions of mobile phones. Data storage capacity has increased, while its cost has plummeted. Data scientists now have unprecedented computing power at their disposal, and they are devising algorithms that are ever more sophisticated.</p>\n<p>In the marketing world, data is like the secret sauce that makes your burger taste better than the rest. It allows businesses to create targeted marketing campaigns, understand consumer behavior, and make informed decisions. It's like having a crystal ball that tells you what your customers want before they even know it themselves.</p>\n<p>But Here's the Catch: <strong>Actions Speak Louder Than Dashboards</strong></p>\n<p>While data is powerful, it's not enough to merely collect it and display it on fancy dashboards. Some companies become obsessed with tracking all the metrics, picking and choosing anything that makes them look good that week. But here's the thing: data is not a beauty contest. It's a tool for action.</p>\n<p>Getting things done and failing fast could be a better way if you're not actually doing anything with the data. Tracking it is not enough; you need actionable insights and then execution. It's like having a map but not taking the journey. The real adventure lies in using the map to explore new territories.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, the role of data in marketing is set to evolve in unprecedented ways. The advent of new tools, particularly in machine learning and deep learning, will unlock a myriad of applications across various sectors. </p>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-accent\"><div class=\"kg-callout-text\"><p><b><strong>Imagine</strong></b><span> customer service managed by intelligent systems, logistics optimized by predictive algorithms, medical records analyzed for personalized healthcare marketing, or even news stories crafted by AI to cater to individual reader preferences.</span></p></div></div>\n<p>These advancements are not just about automation; they're about personalization and precision. </p>\n<p><strong>In the future, data will enable marketers to tailor messages so accurately that each customer feels like the product or service is made just for them</strong>. It's about moving from a one-size-fits-all approach to a tailor-made strategy for each customer.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the future of data in marketing will be about real-time insights and immediate action. As data collection and analysis become more streamlined and instantaneous, marketers will be able to adjust their strategies on the fly, <strong>responding to market trends and consumer behavior in real-time</strong>.</p>\n<p>Think about that. A website/ product that evolves as you use it. Awesome stuff. </p>\n<p>T3B</p>",

      "title": "Stoicism at Work: Do Your Job.",
      "content_html": "<p>Many of us have witnessed this spectacle in workplaces across the world: <strong>everyone seems more interested in how other people are doing their jobs than in doing their own. </strong></p>\n<p>This practice can lead to a drop in productivity, a rise in workplace tension, and a decrease in overall job satisfaction.</p>\n<p>Enter Stoicism, an ancient philosophy with a surprisingly modern relevance, particularly when applied to the work environment. A stoic approach to work can be encapsulated in a three-word mantra: \"<strong>Do your job</strong>.\"</p>\n<p>Stoics believe that by focusing on what we can control and accepting what we cannot, we can achieve peace of mind and a sense of fulfilment. This approach lends itself naturally to the workplace.</p>\n<p>\"Do your job\" is an encapsulation of the core stoic belief in focusing on what one can control and accepting or letting go of what one cannot. In the context of the workplace, the phrase translates to concentrating on the tasks and responsibilities within your purview and letting go of the anxiety and stress about factors outside your control. It encourages individuals to put their energy and focus into performing their tasks to the best of their ability and not getting sidetracked by others' performance or the overall trajectory of the company, which are elements typically beyond their control.</p>\n<p>Embracing a stoic approach at work could mean several things. For one, it could mean that instead of worrying about whether your coworker is pulling their weight, you focus on ensuring that you're doing the best work possible. It could mean that instead of stressing about the company's future, which is beyond your control, you concentrate on performing your current tasks to the best of your abilities. <strong>This mindset doesn't encourage complacency or negligence about the larger picture</strong>; instead, it promotes personal responsibility and effectiveness.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/07/1538573349116.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1051\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/1538573349116.jpeg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/1538573349116.jpeg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/07/1538573349116.jpeg 1051w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span>A stoic perspective to life...</span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/varun-srinivasan/\"><span>Varun Srinivasan</span></a><span> - LinkedIn</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The beauty of this philosophy lies in its simplicity. By adopting the Stoic mindset, we <strong>avoid the common traps of workplace politics, comparison, and undue stress</strong>. We foster a culture of personal responsibility, where the focus is on individual tasks and less on interoffice drama.</p>\n<p>Stoicism also emphasises the importance of recognising and accepting our limitations. We can't control everything, and trying to do so only leads to stress and burnout. We can, however, control our actions, responses, and attitude towards our work. By maintaining a level-headed focus on our responsibilities, we can not only improve our productivity but also our overall job satisfaction.</p>\n<p>Adopting a stoic approach doesn't mean ignoring issues or allowing others to shirk their responsibilities. Instead, it's about realising where your sphere of influence begins and ends. When faced with a coworker not pulling their weight, a stoic approach may be to have an open conversation with them or bring up your concerns to a supervisor. This approach doesn't let you become a passive observer but encourages active engagement within your control sphere.</p>\n<p>Try it out. See how it goes. </p>\n<p>T3B</p>",

      "content_html": "<p>We humans are funny creatures. We chase after promotions, dream houses, fancy cars, and idyllic relationships, all in the pursuit of that elusive state known as \"happiness\". </p>\n<p>But how many times have you achieved a long-desired goal, only to find the joy and satisfaction fleeting? This is not a reflection of ingratitude or insatiability, rather, it's a psychological phenomenon known as hedonic adaptation. </p>\n<p>Intriguing, isn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p>Hedonic adaptation, also termed the \"hedonic treadmill,\" is a concept deeply rooted in psychology. It refers to our innate ability to bounce back to a relatively stable level of happiness, despite the highs and lows we experience in life.</p>\n<p>Here's how it works: Imagine landing your dream job. You're ecstatic, of course! You feel a surge of happiness, satisfaction, and achievement. However, as the weeks pass, the joy begins to fade. That new job becomes just... well, your job. This doesn't mean you no longer appreciate your good fortune, it simply reflects your human capacity to adapt to your new normal.</p>\n<p>It's a little like buying a new car. The first few weeks, the smell of fresh leather, the shiny dashboard, the crisp sound system - it all fills you with pleasure. But over time, you stop noticing these details. The car is still a source of satisfaction, but it no longer delivers that initial spike in happiness.</p>\n<p>This is a great little diagram I found over on Medium:</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/06/1-HCYu7nV6-S7a5LJLkjjtYA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"658\" height=\"418\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/1-HCYu7nV6-S7a5LJLkjjtYA.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/06/1-HCYu7nV6-S7a5LJLkjjtYA.png 658w\"><figcaption><span>Hedonic Adaptation: Why Don\u2019t We Feel Satisfied and Happy? - </span><a href=\"https://ozgenurcanbulat.medium.com/?source=post_page-----4f035448e64--------------------------------\" rel=\"noopener follow\"><span>\u00d6zge Nur CANBULAT</span></a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Now, it's not just about the good times. The hedonic treadmill also applies when life hands us lemons. Job loss, breakups, personal loss, while initially causing emotional upset and a dip in happiness, over time, we adjust and return to our prior emotional baseline. It's our emotional resilience at play.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-implications-of-the-hedonic-treadmill\">The Implications of the Hedonic Treadmill</h2>\n<p>But why does hedonic adaptation matter? </p>\n<p>Its significance lies in the insight it offers about the human pursuit of happiness. You see, hedonic adaptation suggests that <strong>external events don't impact our long-term happiness as much as we might think</strong>. So, is striving for that promotion, that house, or that vacation the real key to happiness?</p>\n<p>Many experts say no. </p>\n<p>This doesn't mean we shouldn't aim for success or strive to improve our lives. However, it highlights the importance of not pinning our hopes for long-term happiness on these external achievements.</p>\n<h2 id=\"breaking-free-from-the-treadmill\">Breaking Free From the Treadmill</h2>\n<p>Research suggests focusing on experiences rather than material goods can bring more lasting happiness. Experiences offer fresh and unique moments that are less susceptible to hedonic adaptation.</p>\n<p>Lastly, personal growth and meaningful relationships, rather than simply the pursuit of success or material wealth, have been shown to offer deeper and more sustainable happiness.</p>\n<p>Hedonic adaptation is a fundamental part of our human psychology. It's a phenomenon that's all about balance, helping us to recover from life's blows and keeping us grounded when we're on cloud nine. Understanding hedonic adaptation can offer a valuable perspective shift, reminding us that long-lasting happiness often lies in the simple, the meaningful, and the appreciative. So, while the treadmill keeps turning, remember, it's up to us to dance to our own tune.</p>\n<p>T3B</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><u>References</u>:</p>\n<ol><li>Brickman, P., &amp; Campbell, D. T.

      "content_html": "<p>In our fast-paced world, we are often eager to make changes, disrupt the status quo, and challenge the traditional way of doing things. But what if there was a wisdom in first understanding why things are the way they are before attempting to change them? This is the central theme behind the fascinating concept known as \"Chesterton's Fence\". </p><p>Changes in leadership often begin with what I call 'the Big Bang'. In order to show the board or the investors they aim to make significant change, they will tend to make a big (often over the top) proposal in the first 4-6 weeks. This could be huge layoffs, discontinued systems, organisation restructure etc. </p><p>Often...this is exactly why they were hired...but I would caution haste. </p><p>Chesterton's Fence is a principle that originates from a metaphor by the writer G.K. Chesterton. He posited: </p><blockquote>before you remove a fence (or a law, a tradition, a practice), it's crucial to understand why it was put up in the first place.</blockquote><p>In Chesterton's words, \"If a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly.\" By this, he meant that <strong>it's not sufficient to dismiss something as irrelevant or outdated just because it seems so on the surface</strong>. Instead, it's essential to fully understand its purpose, context, and the problem it was meant to address before discarding it.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/07/Chesterton-s-Fence.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1118\" height=\"842\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/Chesterton-s-Fence.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/Chesterton-s-Fence.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/07/Chesterton-s-Fence.jpg 1118w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><b><strong style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Chesterton's Fence</strong></b><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> - Do not take down a fence until you know why it was put up in the first place</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-chestertons-fence-matters\">Why Chesterton's Fence Matters</h2><p>The concept of Chesterton's Fence reminds us to approach change with a sense of humility and respect for the wisdom embedded in existing systems. <strong>While it's easy to dismiss old practices or traditions as outmoded, they often carry the wisdom of previous generations and address issues that may not be immediately apparent</strong>.</p><p>This doesn't mean we should resist change, but rather, that we should approach it thoughtfully. By understanding the 'why' behind a 'fence', we can make more informed decisions about what to change and how to change it, and anticipate potential problems that the change could bring.</p><p>So, how do we apply this principle in our lives?</p><p>First, <strong>pause before you push for change</strong>. Ask questions, do your research, and make sure you fully understand the purpose of the 'fence' you're thinking of tearing down.</p><p>Second, engage with others.<strong> Seek the perspectives of those who have more experience or a different viewpoint</strong>. They might provide insights about the 'fence' that you hadn't considered.</p><p>Lastly, think critically and creatively. <strong>Is the 'fence' truly outdated, or does it serve a function that's still necessary?</strong> Is there a way to modernize the 'fence' or to achieve its function in a different way?</p><p>Chesterton's Fence is an age-old wisdom that encourages us to approach change with a mindful, inquisitive, and respectful attitude. In our quest for improvement and progress, let's not forget to pay heed to the wisdom of the past. I am a huge benefactor in helping businesses with digital transformation...but there's never hard in inspecting the fence first.</p><p>T3B</p>",

      "content_html": "<p>Today, we are delving into a treasure trove of wisdom from Robert Greene's \"The 48 Laws of Power\" and deciphering its relevance to the world of marketing and leadership. </p>\n<p>Law 1 is encapsulated in the dictum: \"Never Outshine The Master.\" While reminiscent of historical monarchies, this law carries profound wisdom for navigating contemporary corporate labyrinths. It accentuates the significance of artfully managing perceptions and relationships within hierarchical structures.</p>\n<p>Let's begin.</p>\n<h3 id=\"understanding-the-master-pupil-dynamic\"><strong>Understanding the Master-Pupil dynamic</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-accent\"><div class=\"kg-callout-emoji\">\ud83e\udd14</div><div class=\"kg-callout-text\"><p><b><strong>Small disclaimer</strong></b><span>. Power is a VERY delicate dynamic. Law 1 epitomises a balance between exhibiting your brilliance and upholding the respect for those in positions of power. It\u2019s about synergy and coalescence, not dominance or submission.</span></p></div></div>\n<p><strong>In marketing and leadership, the \u201cmaster\u201d could be a client, manager, or target audience.</strong> The underpinnings of this law lie in acknowledging their stature and expertise. By doing so, you pave the way for productive collaborations and secure a firmer footing within the power hierarchy.</p>\n<p>Some strategies:</p>\n<ol><li><strong>Be Humble:</strong> Engage your client or superior in a dialogue, and frame your ideas as augmentations to their own. <strong>Validate their expertise</strong> and gracefully steer the conversation towards how your strategies can complement and bolster theirs.</li></ol>\n<p>Some words of wisdom from Dale Carnegie resonate here: \u201c<em>A person's name is to him or her the sweetest and most important sound in any language.</em>\u201d Use it. Excessivley.</p>\n<p>In public, business settings if an idea goes down well, I will often present it not as my own. The credit will go to my superior or to my team. People crave attention and acceptance. If you are indifferent to it yourself you can 'gift' it to others. </p>\n<ol><li><strong>Sharing Triumphs:</strong> President Harry Truman once declared, \u201cIt's amazing what you can accomplish when you do not care who gets the credit.\u201d When success graces your marketing campaigns, attribute due credit to your team, your clients\u2019 sagacity, and everyone\u2019s combined efforts. </li></ol>\n<p>This not only prevents you from overshadowing the master but also fosters an ethos of mutual respect and collaboration.</p>\n<ol><li><strong>Diplomacy and Perception:</strong> In the realms of power, perceptions hold sway. Employ tactful communication to <strong>assert your competence without exuding hostility</strong>. This involves understanding the perspectives of the \u201cmaster\u201d and aligning your actions and communication accordingly.</li></ol>\n<p>Too often do I see employees 'bulldozing' their ideas and theories onto their superiors. When you understand the 'game' - employees are there to make their superiors look good. Although developing a voice is important, it should never be at a detriment to your position or your reputation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"self-promotion-dont-forget-it\"><strong>Self-Promotion. Don't forget it. </strong></h3>\n<p>While the law cautions against overshadowing your master, it does not advocate total self-effacement. This is where the art of self-promotion comes into play. It is a vital skill that needs to be honed and this is not the blog to cover such a large topic. Having said that, here are a few pointers:</p>\n<p>Self-promotion is about tactfully highlighting your contributions and skills without sounding arrogant or threatening.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Timing is Key:</strong> Choose the right moments to share your achievements. Be mindful of the context and the mood.</li><li><strong>Provide Value:</strong> Position your accomplishments as value additions for the team or organization.</li><li><strong>Use Data and Metrics:</strong> Use quantifiable data to back your achievements. This lends credibility to your claims without appearing boastful.</li></ul>\n<h3 id=\"harmonising-your-brilliance-with-respect\">Harmonising<strong> Your Brilliance with Respect</strong></h3>\n<p>In conclusion, the law of \"Never Outshine The Master\" is not a call to dim your light, but rather an invitation to strategically direct your brilliance. It encourages you to showcase your capabilities and talents, all while maintaining a healthy respect for the established hierarchy. In the multifaceted world of marketing and leadership, this approach fosters a cooperative environment, paves the way for productive collaborations, and ultimately leads to mutual growth and success.</p>\n<p>Embracing this law doesn't mean losing your individuality, but leveraging it in a way that enhances the whole team or project. Remember, it's not about suppressing your creativity but about knowing when and how to assert it, creating a harmonious balance of power. So, as you progress in your marketing and leadership journey, let this wisdom guide you towards meaningful and respectful relationships, fostering an environment where everyone shines together.</p>\n<p>T3B</p>\n<p>This post was a suggestion from one of our subscribers; <a href=\"https://thinkpeculiar.wordpress.com\">Thinkpeculiar</a>.</p>",

I build websites, pack them with content, stay committed for a few months then wipe the slate clean and start a new project. I work with digital technology every day and I\u2019m never short on business ideas and side projects yet I can never stick with one long enough to see it through.</p><p>The Third Blog is the blog I stick with\u2026as this time I\u2019m not doing it for anyone else but me. </p><p><strong>It will be an odyssey of curiosity and self-reflection</strong>. It's the canvas where I journal the \"interesting, useful,\" and the thought-evoking.</p><p>Once a hub for my venture into Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, this space has morphed into a sanctuary for my musings. It's not about reaching out to the world, but reaching within, documenting insights that I may revisit, akin to a digital journal. It\u2019s about the meditative cadence of penning down thoughts, fueled by an array of interests\u2014productivity, minimalism, martial arts, languages, fitness, technology, and beyond.</p><p>I realised a few months ago, <strong>you don\u2019t need to be an expert to write online</strong>. There is plenty of content out there and i\u2019m just adding my voice to it. Self promotion has never come easy to me. It\u2019s a lot more comfortable to just get the work done and move on.

It\u2019s that simple.\u201d</blockquote><blockquote>\u201cTeaching people doesn\u2019t subtract value from what you do, it actually adds to it. When you teach someone how to do your work, you are, in effect, generating more interest in your work.

      "content_html": "<p>In the vast tapestry of human interactions, we often come across individuals who hold a seemingly insignificant amount of power but wield it with the intensity of a medieval monarch.</p><p>These fascinating characters, whom we lovingly refer to as \u201cpetty tyrants,\u201d manage to transform even the most mundane situations into mini-dramas. While their reign may be confined to everyday life, their impact can be remarkably memorable. My Dad first introduced me to the term as a teenager and it\u2019s been with me ever since. Make yourself aware of this \u2018everyday devil\u2019 and see what you can learn.</p><blockquote><br><strong>A petty tyrant is a tormentor.</strong> Someone who either holds the power of life and death over warriors or simply annoys them to distraction.<em>~CARLOS CASTANEDA \u2013 THE FIRE FROM WITHIN~</em></blockquote><p>At first glance, dealing with petty tyrants may appear nothing more than an exercise in frustration. However, upon closer inspection, we can uncover some surprising benefits that make putting up with their actions and attitudes worthwhile, if only begrudgingly.</p><p>Remember, \u201cEvery level has a devil,\u201d and Petty Tyrants are the little devils who dance on the pinheads of our patience. Their realm might be limited, but they stir emotions at every turn and drive us to distraction. Is there anything we can learn from them? Maybe so:</p><p><strong>Attention to Detail</strong>: Petty tyrants are known for their meticulousness and unwavering adherence to rules. While their nitpicky nature can be exasperating, it also serves as a constant reminder to pay attention to the finer points. By observing their meticulous approach, we may develop our own eye for detail, which can prove advantageous in various aspects of life, such as work projects, personal organisation, or even creative endeavours.</p><p><strong>Order and Efficiency</strong>: One of the unintended consequences of petty tyrants is the establishment of order and efficiency within their domains. Their zealous enforcement of rules and protocols can prevent chaos from taking hold. Although their methods may seem excessive, they often create an environment where tasks are executed with precision, deadlines are met, and overall productivity is heightened.</p><p><strong>Character Development</strong>: Interacting with petty tyrants can serve as a character-building exercise. While their actions and attitudes may test our patience, it provides an opportunity to cultivate resilience, adaptability, and diplomacy. By navigating the challenges posed by petty tyrants, we enhance our emotional intelligence, sharpen our communication skills, and develop strategies to handle difficult personalities\u2014an invaluable skill set for both personal and professional growth.</p><!--members-only--><p><strong>A Source of Humour</strong>: Let\u2019s not forget the entertainment value that petty tyrants unknowingly provide. Their exaggerated reactions, meticulous attention to trivial matters, and the sheer absurdity of their perceived authority can elicit a smile or a chuckle. By adopting a lighthearted perspective, we can transform our annoyance into amusement, making these encounters a source of comedic relief in the tapestry of our lives.</p><blockquote>\u201cMy benefactor used to say that a warrior who stumbles on a petty tyrant is a lucky one.\u201d<em>~DON JUAN~</em></blockquote><p><strong>Engage them with a bit of charm</strong>, <strong>a sprinkle of patience</strong>, and if all else fails, some judicious flattery. You\u2019ll soon realise that beneath that tyrannical veneer often lies a kindred spirit just seeking a bit of recognition. You might even end up swapping biscuit preferences with your Petty Tyrant. In my case\u2026I\u2019ve converted mine to a modern \u2018little finger\u2019. They whisper me secrets and navigate business politics that I would otherwise prefer to avoid.</p><p>By understanding the underlying motivations and utility of petty tyrants, we can approach our interactions with them in a more empathetic manner. Instead of dismissing their actions as merely annoying, we can recognise that they are acting based on their own perception of control, pursuit of perfection, and the need for order and structure. In business, perhaps moving them to a different role would help.</p><p>While their methods may not align with our own, acknowledging their role and utility can help us navigate their quirks with a touch of patience and understanding. After all, in the tapestry of human interactions, it takes all kinds of personalities to create a balanced and diverse world.</p><p>Who is your petty tyrant?</p><p>T3B</p>",

His compelling works provide deep insights into how individuals can attain power and maintain it. Today we\u2019re looking at law 30.</p><p>This principle is not only applicable to personal growth and power dynamics, but also, interestingly, to the field of marketing:</p><blockquote>Law 30 \u2013 \u201cMake your accomplishments seem effortless\u201dThe 48 Laws of Power \u2013 Robert Greene</blockquote><p>In the vast ocean of modern marketing, conveying your brand\u2019s message with clarity and simplicity is no small feat. The ability to make the complex seem uncomplicated is an art form that every marketer needs to master. So, how can we translate this power law into our marketing strategies?</p><p><em>This is the 3rd blog in my Robert Greene series on marketing. Checkout </em><a href=\"https://thethirdblog.com/2023/04/12/winning-hearts-and-gathering-intel/\"><em>law 14</em></a><em> \u2013 \u201cPose as a Friend, Work as a Spy\u201d and </em><a href=\"https://thethirdblog.com/2023/04/13/win-through-actions-never-through-argument/\"><em>Law 9</em></a><em> \u2013 \u201cWin Through Your Actions, Never Through Argument,\u201d. They\u2019re super fun to write!</em></p><p><strong>Simplicity in Messaging</strong></p><p>Your marketing message should be like a beacon of light in a dense fog, clear and direct. Your audience shouldn\u2019t need a dictionary or a degree to understand what you\u2019re offering. The simpler and more engaging your message is, the more accessible it becomes to your audience.</p><p><strong>Crafting the Seamless Customer Journey</strong></p><p>Creating an effortless experience for your customers from start to finish is the gold standard in marketing. An intuitive website, clear calls-to-action, easy purchasing processes, and reliable customer service are all elements of a seamless customer journey. It\u2019s about making every interaction as easy as possible, creating the perception that using your product or service is a breeze.</p><p><strong>The Art of Show, Don\u2019t Tell</strong></p><p>While you definitely want to highlight the value of your product, avoid getting caught up in explaining the blood, sweat, and tears that went into creating it. Instead, focus on showcasing the benefits to the customer through engaging storytelling and relatable content. After all, customers are more interested in what they get out of the product rather than the effort it took to make it.</p><p><strong>Unveiling Complexity Gradually</strong></p><p>If your product or service is complex, avoid overwhelming your customers by revealing its intricacies gradually. This allows them to become comfortable with the basics before moving onto the advanced features. As a result, their learning process feels smooth and effortless, thereby enhancing their user experience.</p><p><strong>Demonstrate Mastery</strong></p><p>Confidence and proficiency in what you do is incredibly appealing. Similar to how a skilled athlete makes a challenging sport look easy, your brand should exude a sense of mastery. Whether this is in the way you handle customer queries, troubleshoot issues, or innovate within your field, this demonstration of competence can foster trust and ultimately, increase sales.</p><p><strong>Automation: The Future of Effortless Interactions</strong></p><p>Now with my CS hat on, the rise of technology has introduced a myriad of tools that can help streamline and automate processes, making transactions and interactions more seamless from the customer\u2019s perspective. Whether it\u2019s chatbots for instant customer support or AI-driven personalization tools, the integration of technology can indeed make the customer journey appear effortlessly smooth.</p><p>Ultimately, the essence of Law 30: \u201cMake your accomplishments seem effortless\u201d lies in the art of subtlety and finesse in marketing. By prioritizing simplicity, seamless experiences, and demonstrating mastery, you can truly captivate your audience, making the road to conversion appear as effortless as a walk in the park.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card kg-card-hascaption\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"__GHOST_URL__/effortless-marketing/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Effortless Marketing - Part 2</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">True marketing mastery lies in making hard work appear effortless.

      "content_html": "<p><strong>Picture this</strong>: You have a niche product or service that you\u2019re passionate about. You\u2019ve spent time perfecting it, but the thought of mass marketing, expensive advertising campaigns, and hustling for customer attention feels overwhelming. But what if there was a different way? What if, instead of chasing millions of customers, you focused on acquiring just 1000 true fans? What if you leveraged AI to streamline your creativity and automate tasks, creating a highly profitable one-person business? Sounds utopian? Maybe not.</p><p>This concept isn\u2019t a pipe dream anymore. With the rise of community-focused business models and cutting-edge AI tools, the landscape of entrepreneurship is rapidly evolving. In this blog post, I will explore how you can leverage AI for creativity and automation to build a sustainable and highly profitable one-person business for your 1000 true fans.</p><p>Co-founder of Wired magazine, Kevin Kelly, introduced an intriguing idea that got me thinking: the \u201c<a href=\"https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/\">1000 True Fans</a>\u201d concept. He proposed that a creator can make a comfortable living by focusing not on the masses but on nurturing a community of just 1000 true fans \u2014 fans who genuinely appreciate and support their offerings.</p><p>If each of these fans were to spend \u00a3100 annually on your products or services, that would accumulate to an income of \u00a3100,000 per year. Beyond the financial gains, this approach opens up an opportunity for more personal, meaningful interactions with customers.</p><h3 id=\"beyond-ads-the-power-of-community\"><strong>Beyond Ads: The Power of Community</strong></h3><p>Embracing the 1000 true fans concept calls for a radical shift in how we view business growth. It suggests that fostering a strong community may prove more beneficial than investing heavily in traditional advertising.</p><p>The recent advancements in AI have me excited about its potential to reshape businesses built on the 1000 true fans model. AI could potentially enhance creativity, automate tasks, and deliver personalised experiences for different fan bases, enabling entrepreneurs like myself to manage multiple ventures.</p><p>Imagine AI tools sparking new ideas and expediting content creation, or handling routine tasks like customer service and social media management. Think about the personalised experiences AI could deliver, strengthening the bond between creator and supporter.</p><h3 id=\"a-fully-automated-business-model\"><strong>A Fully Automated Business Model?</strong></h3><p>As I delve deeper into the potential of AI, I find myself contemplating the level of automation it could bring to the 1000 true fans model. Could the process be entirely automated?</p><p>While AI can handle many aspects like content creation, customer interaction, and personalisation, the essence of the 1000 true fans model <em>originally</em> lies in the genuine relationship between creators and fans. Therefore, it may not be desirable \u2014 or even possible \u2014 to fully automate this model. That said, AI can undoubtedly streamline operations, freeing up more time for creators to build those all-important connections.</p><p>Something to also consider is how genuine these \u2018genuine relationships\u2019 are or need to be. As a business grows, the 1:1 interactions with customers will undoubtedly get harder and harder. You can see this with the huge growth and media attention around Only Fans. Many models have openly discussed how they had to <a href=\"https://www.indy100.com/viral/onlyfans-dms-who-replies-b1983361\">hire assistants to keep up with the heavy intake of DMs and emails from subscribers</a>. Subscribers think they are interacting directly with the models \u2013 actually it\u2019s been outsourced.</p><p>This takes away the \u2018genuine connection\u2019 but ONLY if it\u2019s noticeable. If you could train an AI to think and respond like you, is it the same?</p><p>As I continue to explore the intersection of the 1000 true fans model, community building, and AI, I can\u2019t help but feel excited about the possibilities for future entrepreneurship. The conversation is far from over, and as we move forward, the future of multiple AI-driven, 1-man, 6-figure businesses could be closer than we think.</p><p>Food for thought!</p><p>T3B</p>",

      "content_html": "<p>Life can often feel like a relentless cascade of mishaps, linked together much like a chain of paperclips. It\u2019s as if a cosmic puppet master is pulling the strings, ensuring that every possible mishap occurs\u2026 and all at once, no less! This, my friend, is the notorious Murphy\u2019s Law, the uninvited guest at every event.</p><p>This unwelcome entity is the one that ensures your laptop freezes moments before an essential presentation or that your morning coffee lands on your pristine shirt. Murphy\u2019s Law is a constant, an ever-present specter, lurking just out of sight, ready to ambush your productivity.</p><p>Recently, I was on the receiving end of a series of misfortunes and decided to delve deeper into this enigma. Today, we\u2019ll be exploring the inner workings of this seemingly malevolent force and how to remain productive when it seems intent on causing disruption.</p><p><strong>Welcome the Unpredictable</strong></p><p>When Murphy\u2019s Law knocks at your door, it\u2019s best to roll out the welcome mat. Rather than allowing frustration or anger to take control when things spiral out of control, seek out the silver lining. Maybe the botched presentation taught you the importance of a plan B. Or the coffee that stained your shirt facilitated a chance encounter with a future business associate. Welcoming the unpredictable can open the door to fresh perspectives, unexpected opportunities, and even a hearty chuckle.</p><p>In the words of Stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius in his Meditations, we should not merely welcome the unpredictable, but anticipate it:</p><blockquote>\u201cBegin each day by telling yourself: Today I shall be meeting with interference, ingratitude, insolence, disloyalty, ill-will, and selfishness \u2013 all of them due to the offenders\u2019 ignorance of what is good or evil.\u201d\u2013 Marcus Aurelius, Meditations</blockquote><p><strong>Harness the Power of Humor</strong></p><p>Let\u2019s be honest: at times, the only way to navigate the tumult of Murphy\u2019s Law is to laugh in the face of it. A sense of humor can be your secret weapon against the onslaught. By finding the humor in life\u2019s oddities, you\u2019re less likely to be engulfed by negativity and more likely to stride forward, a grin lighting up your face.</p><p><strong>Break Down Tasks</strong></p><p>When Murphy\u2019s Law comes into play, it can leave you feeling swamped and immobilized. To counteract this, decompose your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. This way, even if chaos ensues in one area, you can still make headway in another. This was my lifeline when I felt the grip of overwhelm. Remember, progress, no matter how modest, is still progress.</p><p><strong>Prepare for the Unpredictable</strong></p><p>While it may seem paradoxical, one effective strategy against Murphy\u2019s Law is acknowledging its potential and preparing accordingly. Always have a contingency plan, whether it pertains to your tech, your timetable, or your task list. By bracing for the unpredictable, you\u2019ll be well-positioned to tackle any obstacles that life hurls at you. Techniques like the Stoic art of negative visualisation or a <a href=\"https://dailystoic.com/premortem/\">pre-mortem</a> could assist with this.</p><p><strong>Build a Positive Environment</strong></p><p>When everything seems to be going wrong, it\u2019s easy to get sucked into a whirlpool of negativity. To counter this, cultivate a positive environment. Whether it\u2019s through inspiring podcasts, motivational quotes, or a supportive network of friends and family, having a robust foundation can help you stay on track and maintain your productivity, even when Murphy\u2019s Law is doing its utmost to derail you.</p><p>Remember: when life hands you lemons, whip up some lemonade.</p><p>T3B</p>",

      "content_html": "<p>As marketing leaders, we often find ourselves drawn to shiny new ideas and tools, excited by the potential they promise. But what if the keys to true success lie in the shadows, just waiting to be discovered?</p><p>I recently read the following parable from the Bryan Johnson Blueprint and had to find a fun way to apply it to marketing:</p><blockquote>A person is looking for their keys under a street light. Someone walks by and inquires, \u201cAre you certain you lost your keys here?\u201d<br><br>\u201cNo\u201d they reply, \u201cI lost them across the street.\u201d<br><br>Confused, the stranger says, \u201cThen why are you looking here?\u201d<br><br>They responded, \u201cThe light is much brighter here!\u201d<a href=\"https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.co/\">Principle 4</a> \u2013 Bryan Johnson, Blueprint</blockquote><p>Inspired by this age-old parable \u2013 apparently called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect\">streetlight effect</a> \u2013 let\u2019s explore how embracing the darkness can lead to innovative and effective marketing strategies. Let\u2019s dive into the shadows and find out how you can apply this principle to your marketing leadership.</p><ol><li><strong>Dare to Venture Beyond the Light</strong></li></ol><p>In the parable, the person searches for their lost keys under the streetlight, even though they know it\u2019s not where they dropped them. Similarly, marketers often focus on tried-and-tested methods, fearing the unknown. To avoid being blinded by the light, take calculated risks and explore new channels, tactics, or ideas. You may find unexpected opportunities that were hidden in the darkness all along.</p><p>TikTok and other evolving social media channels are a great example of this. To the uneducated, they are for gossip and teenagers. Yet this article features <a href=\"https://www.investisdigital.com/blog/social-media/5-creative-brands-killing-it-on-tiktok\">5 Creative Brands that are Killing it on TikTok</a>; \u00a0the WSJ and apps such as Duolingo are not places you would initially consider.</p><ol><li><strong>Foster a Culture of Curiosity</strong></li></ol><p>Encourage your marketing team to be curious and question conventional wisdom. By fostering a culture that values diverse perspectives and experimentation, you\u2019ll create an environment where innovation thrives. Don\u2019t shy away from challenging the status quo and exploring unconventional marketing approaches. The darkness may hold the key to your next big breakthrough.</p><ol><li><strong>Embrace the Power of Data</strong></li></ol><p>This is without a doubt my favourite. <strong>Data can be a guiding light in the darkness</strong>, providing insights that illuminate hidden opportunities. Make data-driven decisions by investing in data analytics and research. By leveraging data, you\u2019ll make informed choices and uncover valuable insights that may have gone unnoticed in the glare of traditional marketing methods.</p><p>Data-first marketing is something that will make you stand out from the rest. Just as sales and IT has to quantify their output, utilising data allows you to hyper-focus your campaigns and act on facts rather than inkling.</p><p>In many of my job roles, everyone thinks they know something about marketing. Use data to provide insights and backup your business decisions.</p><ol><li><strong>Learn from Failure</strong></li></ol><p>Not every venture into the darkness will lead to success, but failure can be an invaluable teacher. Embrace setbacks and use them to refine your marketing strategies. By learning from failure, you\u2019ll become a more resilient and adaptable marketing leader, ready to face the challenges that lie in the shadows.</p><p>This interview with Giannis Antetokounmpo went viral during a-post game interview about his views on failure. This is something we should all remember and as one comment puts it: \u201cPeople will be replaying this for years to come\u201d. As <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daronkroberts/\">Daron K. Roberts</a> often says, <strong>THIS IS NOT ABOUT SPORT</strong>:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZwlAzr44ys?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\" style=\"max-width: 100%; inset: 0px; height: 448px; position: absolute; width: 796.453125px; border: 0px;\"></iframe></figure><ol><li><strong>Balance Darkness and Light</strong></li></ol><p>While it\u2019s important to explore the darkness, don\u2019t forget the value of the light. Strive for a balance between the tried-and-true and the uncharted. Use your experience and intuition to guide your marketing efforts, while remaining open to new possibilities. This balance will help you create a marketing strategy that is both grounded in reality and primed for innovation.</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p><p>T3B</p>",

These are two linear data structures that play a significant role in organizing and managing data in computer programs.</p><p>We\u2019ll keep this short and sweet. An 80/20 if you will.</p><p>Let\u2019s get started.</p><h2 id=\"stacks\"><strong>Stacks.</strong></h2><p>Imagine a stack of pancakes, with each pancake representing an item in your data structure. To add a pancake, you\u2019d place it on top of the stack, and to remove one, you\u2019d lift the top pancake.</p><p>Stacks work in the same way \u2013 they follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the most recent item added is the first to be removed.</p><p>Let\u2019s break down the basic stack operations to uncover its secrets:</p><ol><li><strong>Push</strong>: Pile on a new pancake (add an item to the top of the stack).</li><li><strong>Pop</strong>: Remove the top pancake (take off the top item).</li><li><strong>Peek/Top</strong>: Sneak a peek at the top pancake (view the top item without removing it).</li></ol><p>By understanding LIFO and basic stack operations, it allows you to explore some of the most appetizing applications of stacks, like evaluating arithmetic expressions, managing function calls, and navigating through graphs with depth-first search. (The latter I\u2019m yet to experiment with).</p><h2 id=\"queues\"><strong>Queues.</strong></h2><p>Now picture a line of people waiting for a bus. New people join at the end of the line, while those at the front board the bus and leave. Queues in computer science follow this same idea, operating under the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first item added is the first to be removed.</p><p>Time to dive into the core queue operations:</p><ol><li><strong>Enqueue</strong>: Join the line (add an item to the rear of the queue).</li><li><strong>Dequeue</strong>: Board the bus (remove the front item from the queue).</li><li><strong>Front</strong>: Check who\u2019s first in line (view the front item without removing it).</li></ol><p>With the FIFO principle and basic queue operations under our belt, it\u2019s possible to tackle some cool queue applications, such as managing tasks in a first-come-first-served manner, exploring graphs with breadth-first search, and buffering data in communication systems.</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p><p>T3B</p>",

      "title": "Dancing with Algorithms: A Playful Introduction to Big O Notation",
      "content_html": "<p>I recently started an MSc in Computer Science and AI. With a pleasant introduction to JAVA and some basic programming tasks, it quickly took a devastating turn into \u2018basic\u2019 data structures and algorithms. Now when I say \u2018basic\u2019, it\u2019s definitely not. As someone very unfamiliar with math, the \u2018basic\u2019 symbols and formula quickly started to confuse. As such, I\u2019m in the process of doing my own mini-course on algebra, calculus and today Big O Notation. My hope is that as I transcribe my own process, it will help me to understand it. If it also helps you, then win: win.</p><p>If you\u2019re a student like me and trying to wrap your head around Big O notation. The way it works and why it\u2019s ESSENTIAL to know and understand, then you\u2019re in the right place! Let\u2019s take a look in a fun and beginner-friendly way:</p><p>Imagine you\u2019re at a party, and the host just announced a dance competition. There are different moves, and each has its unique degree of difficulty. You and your friends want to find out which dance move is the most complex. In the world of computer science, we would use Big O notation to represent the complexity of these dance moves, just like we do with algorithms.</p><p>If you google for a Big O definition, you get this:</p><blockquote>\u201cBig O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. It is a member of a family of notations invented by Paul Bachmann, Edmund Landau, and others, collectively called Bachmann\u2013Landau notation or asymptotic notation.\u201d\u2014 Wikipedia\u2019s definition of Big O notation</blockquote><p>What does that even mean? <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/big-o-notation-why-it-matters-and-why-it-doesnt-1674cfa8a23c/\">FreeCodeCamp</a> does a better job of simplifying and explains that \u2018 Big O notation describes the <strong>complexity</strong> of your code using algebraic terms\u2019.</p><p>Much better.</p><h2 id=\"the-dance-of-algorithms\"><strong>The Dance of Algorithms</strong></h2><p>An algorithm is a series of steps used to solve a problem or perform a task. In computer science, we measure the efficiency of algorithms by looking at their time complexity, which is just a fancy term for the amount of time an algorithm takes to run.</p><p>Now, let\u2019s get back to our dance party. <strong>Each dance move is like an algorithm</strong>, and <strong>the time it takes to perform the move is the algorithm\u2019s time complexity</strong>. Just like dancers aim for smooth and efficient moves, we want our algorithms to be efficient too. And that\u2019s where Big O notation comes in!</p><p>Big O notation is a way to express the upper bound (or worst-case scenario) of an algorithm\u2019s time complexity. In other words, it helps us understand the maximum number of steps an algorithm might take as the size of its input increases.</p><p>Let\u2019s say we have a simple dance move called \u201cThe Clap\u201d that takes one step to perform. No matter how many people are dancing, it will always take one step to perform The Clap. In this case, we\u2019d say the time complexity is O(1) because it\u2019s constant and doesn\u2019t change with the number of dancers.</p><p>But what if we have a more complex move, like \u201cThe Conga Line,\u201d where everyone lines up and follows the leader? The time it takes to perform The Conga Line depends on the number of dancers. If there are n dancers, the time complexity is O(n) because it increases linearly with the number of dancers.</p><h2 id=\"exploring-other-big-o-notations\"><strong>Exploring Other Big O Notations</strong></h2><p>There are many types of Big O notations, each representing different time complexities. Let\u2019s look at a few more using our dance party analogy:</p><ol><li><strong>O(log n):</strong> Imagine a move called \u201cThe Binary Dance,\u201d where you have to divide the dance floor in half, then in half again, and so on, until you find the one spot where you can stand. As the number of dancers increases, the number of steps only grows logarithmically.</li><li><strong>O(n^2):</strong> Picture \u201cThe Partner Swap,\u201d where each dancer has to dance with every other dancer. The number of dance pairs grows quadratically with the number of dancers. The more people at the party, the more time it takes to complete the move!</li><li><strong>O(2^n):</strong> Let\u2019s say there\u2019s a move called \u201cThe Exponential Hustle,\u201d where each dancer has to teach the move to two other dancers, who then teach it to two more dancers, and so on. The number of steps to complete this dance move increases exponentially with the number of dancers.</li></ol><p>The Big O Cheatsheat has some nice explanations and a more in-depth look at all the possibilities:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://thethirdblogdata.files.wordpress.com/2023/04/1_kfzyfut2okfjekjlceyvuq.jpeg?w=800\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"556\"><figcaption>Complexity Growth Illustration from&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bigocheatsheet.com/\" style=\"color: var(--wp--preset--color--primary); text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer; text-decoration-thickness: 1px; text-underline-offset: 0.3em;\">Big O Cheatsheet</a></figcaption></figure><p>Understanding Big O notation is essential because it helps us choose the most efficient algorithm for a particular task. It\u2019s like choosing the best dance move for the song that\u2019s playing \u2013 you don\u2019t want to pick a move that takes too long or is too complicated when there\u2019s a simpler and more point-efficient version.</p><p>Remember, the goal is to choose the right algorithm (or dance move) for the task at hand, and knowing the time complexity can make all the difference.</p><p>I hope this helps.</p><p>T3B</p>",

      "content_html": "<p>Once upon a time, in a land not so far away, I was strolling through the endless digital forest of businesses, where everything looked suspiciously similar. It was like a scene from \u201cAttack of the Clones,\u201d except instead of stormtroopers, it was businesses in every industry. The branding, messaging, and style \u2013 all so identical that I yawned and nearly fell asleep on my keyboard.</p><p>As a marketing maestro, I couldn\u2019t let this cloning calamity continue without casting comment. I recently wrote about \u2018breaking free from the <a href=\"https://thethirdblog.com/2023/04/01/business-the-chains-of-logic/\">chains of logic</a>\u2019 and this weekend had further time to delve back into a great book from Rory Sutherland titled Alchemy. Now I want to help businesses break free from the sea of sameness and stand out like the beautiful, unique snowflakes they truly are.</p><p>Alchemy talks about behavioural economics in marketing and advertising. Lets explore four strategies to vanquish cloning and conquer creativity using using the following principles:</p><p><strong>Strategy 1: The Art of the Nudge</strong></p><p>Our first strategy on this whirlwind tour is incorporating nudges. Nudges are subtle cues that guide people towards making better decisions. One example of a nudge is a sign placed near the exit of a room in an office building, reminding employees to turn off the lights when they leave to conserve energy.</p><p>For instance, you could send out personalized email reminders to your customers about a limited-time offer, emphasizing how previous customers took advantage of similar deals and benefited greatly from them. This nudge creates a sense of urgency and fosters the idea that they, too, should seize the opportunity before it\u2019s gone. By harnessing the power of creative nudges, your brand can break free from the sea of sameness and create an identity all its own.</p><p><strong>Strategy 2: Harnessing the Power of Scarcity</strong></p><p>Next, we delve into the mystical realm of scarcity. By harnessing the fear of missing out (FOMO), we discover that businesses can create a sense of urgency and exclusivity. Offering limited editions, flash sales, or time-sensitive promotions can help transform your brand from just another clone to the must-have, one-of-a-kind unicorn.</p><p>Picture your customers scrambling to get their hands on your limited edition, glow-in-the-dark widgets. Who wouldn\u2019t want one of those? I know I\u2019d be first in line.</p><p><strong>Strategy 3: Leveraging Social Proof</strong></p><p>Our journey then leads us to the power of social proof. By leveraging the opinions and actions of others, we can create trust and credibility for our brand.</p><p>Incorporate testimonials, ratings, and reviews into your marketing to show potential customers that they\u2019re not alone in their love for your brand. And don\u2019t be afraid to showcase the number of satisfied customers or your most impressive collaborations.</p><p>Think about it: Would you rather buy a widget from a company with no reviews, or one with glowing recommendations from Oprah, Elon Musk, and the Queen of England? I know who I\u2019d trust with my widget needs.</p><p><strong>Strategy 4: Mastering the Art of Framing</strong></p><p>As our adventure nears its end, we stumble upon the concept of framing. The way we present information can dramatically influence how it\u2019s perceived.</p><p>To stand out, experiment with unconventional framing. Don\u2019t just tell your audience that your widget is made of durable titanium \u2013 tell them it\u2019s virtually indestructible, even if they accidentally drop it into an active volcano.</p><p>My exploration of behavioral economics taught me that the secret to standing out in a world of clones is to embrace the weird, the unexpected, and the downright delightful. By understanding the power of nudges, scarcity, social proof, and framing, we can drive creativity and break free from the sea of sameness.</p><p>Share this post with someone that needs to see it!</p><p>T3B</p>",

      "content_html": "<p>In the world of business, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the pursuit of logic and efficiency. After all, logic is the driving force behind many decision-making processes and strategic planning. However, when everyone follows the same logical path, it can lead to a lack of creativity and excitement, resulting in businesses that are indistinguishable from one another. In this post, I explore the problems of prioritising logic and masking creativity.</p><blockquote>\u201cwhen you demand logic, you pay a hidden price: you destroy magic\u201d\u2015 RORY SUTHERLAND, ALCHEMY</blockquote><p>Logic is a powerful yet predictable tool.</p><p>It helps streamline processes, maximize efficiency, and ensure that decisions are based on sound reasoning. However, <strong>when every business adheres strictly to logic, the result is a very predictable landscape</strong>. Take one look at a string of competitors\u2019 websites and each are nearly as indistinguishable as the next. The same style, the same messaging, the same model. \u201cWe offer the best product, the best service and the best value in the market.\u201d BORING!</p><blockquote>It is much easier to be fired for being illogical than it is for being unimaginative. The fatal issue is that logic always gets you to exactly the same place as your competitors.\u2015 RORY SUTHERLAND, ALCHEMY</blockquote><p>Creativity, on the other hand, is the force that drives innovation and sets businesses apart. It\u2019s the source of unexpected ideas, memorable experiences, and game-changing breakthroughs. Creativity is what allows businesses to break free from the mold and take risks that can lead to remarkable success. When creativity is allowed to thrive, businesses can stand out in a sea of sameness and create a lasting impression on their customers.</p><p>The key to avoiding the monotony of an overly logical business landscape lies in finding the right balance between logic and creativity. By combining the analytical power of logic with the imaginative energy of creativity, businesses can develop unique products, services, and marketing strategies that not only make sense but also captivate their audience.</p><p>So how can you do that? I\u2019m glad you asked, here are some ideas:</p><ul><li><strong>Encourage a culture of experimentation</strong>: Foster an environment where employees feel comfortable sharing unconventional ideas and trying new approaches. This can lead to breakthrough innovations that differentiate your business from competitors.</li><li><strong>Embrace storytelling</strong>: Instead of focusing solely on data-driven messaging, incorporate storytelling into your marketing efforts to create emotional connections with your audience. A compelling story can make your brand unforgettable and resonate deeply with customers.</li><li><strong>Prioritize design</strong>: Pay attention to the design aspects of your products, services, and online presence. A unique and visually appealing design can make your brand stand out and leave a lasting impression on your customers.</li><li><strong>Diversify your team</strong>: A diverse team, with members from different backgrounds and expertise, can bring fresh perspectives and ideas to the table. Encourage collaboration and open dialogue to fuel creativity and innovation within your business.</li><li><strong>Keep an eye on trends, but don\u2019t be afraid to challenge them</strong>: Stay informed about industry trends, but don\u2019t be afraid to challenge the status quo. Sometimes, going against the grain can lead to groundbreaking solutions and help your business stand out from the competition.</li></ul><p>While logic is an essential component of business success, it\u2019s crucial not to neglect the power of creativity. By striking the right balance between the two, businesses can create unique and exciting experiences that leave a lasting impression on their customers and set them apart from the competition.</p><p>So, let\u2019s embrace the excitement of creativity and make our businesses stand out in a world of similarity. No more clone-wars branding and doppelg\u00e4nger messaging. Pick something new, tell a story and stand out from the crowd.</p><p>Good luck.</p><p>T3B</p>",

      "content_html": "<p>While writing <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/the-race-for-ai/\">The Race for AI</a> article, I had to stop and think. The advent of ground-breaking language models entering the market is having a profound effect on the way we search and find answers to life\u2019s many questions. Traditionally a search engine was the most effective and we relied on a bunch of secret algorithms to determine the best result. Now, that is changing.</p><p>In the past, search engine optimization (SEO) professionals focused on optimizing webpages to increase organic traffic and achieve higher rankings in the search engine results pages (SERPs). However, with the introduction of paid ads and featured snippets, it has become more challenging to land on page one of the SERPs, let alone the top 1-3 links.</p><p>As AI continues to evolve and become more advanced, it is likely that traditional search engines will play a less significant role in the way we search for information. AI-infused tools are becoming more adept at providing quick and accurate answers without displaying the source. This could potentially diminish the importance of website ranking and visibility in SERPs.</p><p>What happens next when we can no longer see the websites that our answer is referencing? Siri shows us the website reference. Chat-GPT and other AI infused tools just give us an answer and unless requested, never display the source.</p><p>Sometimes it\u2019s an amalgamation of results that have been summarised, but the individual opinion and prestige from specific blogs or journalists is starting to disappear.</p><p>What are the implications? How does this effect SEO and how does this change our approach to content optimisation?</p><p>As language models continue to evolve and become more advanced, it is likely that we will see further changes to the way we search and find information. The reliance on traditional search engines may decrease as more AI infused tools are developed to provide us with quick and accurate answers.</p><p>This could have a significant impact on SEO and content optimization, as the importance of website ranking and visibility in SERPs may diminish. As a result, businesses and content creators WILL need to shift their focus towards creating high-quality content that is easily discoverable by AI tools and voice assistants.</p><p>How is this done?</p><p>That\u2019s the million-dollar question.</p><p>T3B</p>",

      "content_html": "<p>It all seemed to start with chat-GPT back in November. The first specs of an open source, free AI language model graced the internet. Once the media got hold of it, it was everywhere. News, magazines, videos, articles \u2013 everyone wanted to showcase how it could write a script and after an interesting piece of content they would drop the \u2018bomb\u2019: \u201cThis whole video was actually written by chat-GPT\u2019. Okay we get it.</p><p>I\u2019m yet to write my thoughts about chat-GPT to paper and delve a bit deeper into how I\u2019ve been using it to turbocharge my education and business, but something I wanted to chat about today is the technology race currently underway. I already spoke about how having no artificial intelligence in your business could be effecting sales\u2026so it\u2019s curious to see how in only 6 months the term, the functionalities and the \u2018benefits\u2019 are seemingly EVERYWHERE.</p><p><strong>OpenAI</strong> &amp; Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</p><p>Commercially, <a href=\"https://openai.com/\">OpenAI</a> seems to be where everything started. Putting the MANY other applications of AI and machine learning aside (<em>recommendation engines in Netflix, virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa, image recognition for Facebook or self-driving cars</em>), chat-gpt was the language model that made ordinary people stand up and pay attention. Until then, AI applications we\u2019re being built by \u2018nerds\u2019 and utilised by the unknowing. It was a term that was filled with unknown and visions of a robot-ruled dictatorship.</p><p>Elon musk has commented many times of the caution required when developing such technology, but a model that could converse like a human, understand the conversation, context and solve your homework was FAR too exciting. The world went mad.</p><blockquote>\u201cI\u2019m a little worried about AI stuff. I think it\u2019s something we should be concerned about,\u201d Musk said. \u201cWe should need some kind of regulatory authority or something, overseeing AI development and making sure it\u2019s operating within the public interest\u201d-Elon Musk</blockquote><p>Operating within the public interest? Welcome OpenAI.</p><p>A bit of background \u2013 OpenAI were built to build and plan for AGI. So what is AGI?</p><blockquote>AGI stands for artificial general intelligence, which refers to an AI system that possesses intelligence that is comparable to human beings in terms of its ability to understand, learn, reason, and adapt to new situations. AGI is considered by many to be the next frontier in the development of artificial intelligence, with potential applications in fields such as healthcare, education, and robotics. OpenAI is a company that was specifically built to develop and plan for AGI. \u2013<a href=\"https://www.craft.do/blog/craft-ai-assistant\">Craft Assistant</a></blockquote><p>They discuss the plans, benefits and potential issues with this approach extensively on their website. Something interesting was that \u201ccreating AGI will require huge amounts of compute and thus the world will know who is working on it\u201d. This is super important and goes a long way when \u2018policing\u2019 and controlling the technology. Thankfully \u2018it seems like the original conception of hyper-evolved RL agents competing with each other and evolving intelligence in a way we can\u2019t really observe is less likely than it originally seemed\u2019. \u2013 <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond\">OpenAI, Planning for AGI and beyond</a>.</p><p>With vastly improved responses from Chat-GPT, OpenAI quickly became a threat to the King of search; Google. How could voice assistants such as Siri and Alexa be so trash when there was technology like this available? That\u2019s what I thought! Now I no longer have to wade through pages of google results to find what I need. The answer is right here. (SLIGHTLY similar to google snippets, but better!) Tech businesses had to respond and this is what this post will cover.</p><p>Let\u2019s take a look at arguably the most exciting week in AI development. The latest release of Chat-GPT 4, PaLM-E from Google, Microsoft 365 integrations and a bunch of software development/ partnerships. Let\u2019s go:</p><p><strong>Chat GPT-4</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://openai.com/product/gpt-4\">GPT-4</a>, the successor to GPT-3, boasts several significant improvements. With a larger model size and more diverse training data, GPT-4 demonstrates enhanced performance, accuracy, and context understanding compared to its predecessor.</p><p>Lately in the news, there\u2019s been lots of discussion around how students have been using the tool to write essays and answer homework. This example from the OpenAI website amazes me as it\u2019s a different take on the potential uses in education. In many cases, the maluse of many of these tools is first to hit the headlines, but check this out. When I read this, I see a future of education where every student has access to a private tutors. Certain parameters can be fed into the system and there you have it \u2013 a private tutor for any student.</p><p>I\u2019m not saying this text-based interface is the best way to interact but just look at the output from this \u2018socratic tutor\u2019. The potential applications are undeniable and a huge step forward in individualised learning.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://thethirdblogdata.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/socratic-tutor.png?w=1024\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2778\" height=\"1940\"></figure><p>This potential was instantly seen AND utilised by Khan Academy, with the introduction of their new <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/khan-labs\">Khanmigo assistant</a>. This takes online learning a step further by providing additional help within any course, assignment or revision. I\u2019d recommend you watch the video and delve into the website but there are applications for both students and teachers.</p><p>Need to make a lesson plan? Get help from a \u2018virtual assistant\u2019 and spend more time 1:1 with your students. I mentioned before about a series of articles on applications of AI across each industry. For education, this is huge.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://thethirdblogdata.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/khanmigo.jpeg?w=1024\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2778\" height=\"1030\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yEgHrxvLsz0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\" style=\"max-width: 100%; inset: 0px; height: 483.75px; position: absolute; width: 860px; border: 0px;\"></iframe></figure><p><strong>BING &amp; Google Bard (Search)</strong></p><p>I deliberately put Bing first in the title as I\u2019m super impressed with the way they\u2019ve fought to remain relevant in the search world. <a href=\"https://blogs.bing.com/search/march_2023/Confirmed-the-new-Bing-runs-on-OpenAI%E2%80%99s-GPT-4\">Bing is now powered by Chat-GPT 4</a> and as upgrades and developments are made to the model, so to their product will improve. As a marketer, it\u2019s interesting to see a search engine shift from complex algorithms and SERP monetisation to a model that appears to just want to give you a more relevant and \u2018human\u2019 answer. I\u2019m not saying that this won\u2019t be monetised \u2013 after all a business is a business \u2013 but with search engine optimisation (SEO) as an entire field, there is definitely a shift towards amalgamating information rather than promoting specific web pages. This is super interesting and well worth a separate post!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://thethirdblogdata.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/cleanshot-2023-03-23-at-11.10.24.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1362\" height=\"886\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.bing.com/new?toWww=1&amp;redig=2BBAFEC880CE44EDABBF9B0FABC7DB78\" style=\"color: var(--wp--preset--color--primary); text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer; text-decoration-thickness: 1px; text-underline-offset: 0.3em;\">Introducing the new Bing</a>: Ask real questions. Get complete answers. Chat and create.</figcaption></figure><p>Anyway! Google has responded with their own version of AI-powered search. As previously mentioned, chat-GPT was a serious threat to the search engine so it was only a matter of time until they published something similar. What I like about Bard is the use-cases and intended use are crystal clear. As the name suggests, it\u2019s promoted as a tool for storytelling and like similar models, aims to make large quantities of information and computing more accessible through conversational AI.</p><p>In 2021 Google released something called LaMDA; a Language Model for Dialogue Applications. I wrote and built a <a href=\"https://thethirdblog.com/2022/04/06/rule-based-chatbots/\">rule-based chat-bot</a> here in another post, but this takes things further. Due to the open nature of conversations, a deep learning/ generative chat-bot now allows a user to explore a wider range of topics. For eg. On an e-commerce website \u2013 you might start by asking if this shirt is available in another colour, but quickly move on to what shoes would best match.</p><p>From the website; \u201c<a href=\"https://bard.google.com/\">Bard</a> is an experiment based on this same technology that lets you collaborate with generative AI. As a creative and helpful collaborator, Bard can supercharge your imagination, boost your productivity, and help you bring your ideas to life\u2014whether you want help planning the perfect birthday party and drafting the invitation, creating a pro &amp; con list for a big decision, or understanding really complex topics simply.\u201d</p><p><strong>Google Workspace &amp; Microsoft Co-Pilot</strong></p><p>Attempting to unify many of the standalone AI tools currently in the market, Workspace and Co-Pilot will fit quite nicely into the workflows of people already on these systems. It brings together the beauty of language models with the functionality of 365 or the Google suite, promising seamless integrations between documents, presentations and email.</p><p>Again, this is a nice reminder that AI will not replace us. For sure, there are some jobs that are certainly at risk, but for the majority of us, we can use it to augment our lives rather than ruin them. The differences will come when employees try to utilise these resources at work. Those that understand the correct prompts and can incorporate the time-saving functionalities will quickly exceed the output of those that don\u2019t. It\u2019s also a nice introduction to people apprehensive of the Chat-GPT interface. Although accessible, this takes it to a whole new level.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/S7xTBa93TX8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\" style=\"max-width: 100%; inset: 0px; height: 483.75px; position: absolute; width: 860px; border: 0px;\"></iframe></figure><p>I\u2019m curious as to how both companies will choose to roll this out. I feel like it could me monetised at company level, but at first there will only be specific teams members who want to take advantage of all the features. If there\u2019s a standalone, personal version, I\u2019m in for sure. If it\u2019s going to rely on me having to convince my employer\u2026uptake will not doubt be MUCH slower.</p><p><strong>Google PaLM-E &amp; Tesla Optimus</strong> (Robotics)</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://thethirdblogdata.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/tesla-optimus-bot.jpeg?w=990\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"990\" height=\"556\"><figcaption>Image Source =&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.20minutos.es/tecnologia/moviles-dispositivos/optimus-el-robot-humanoide-de-tesla-que-hara-tareas-peligrosas-y-que-tiene-la-intencion-de-ser-amigable-5026590/\" style=\"color: var(--wp--preset--color--primary); text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer; text-decoration-thickness: 1px; text-underline-offset: 0.3em;\">https://www.20minutos.es/tecnologia/moviles-dispositivos/optimus-el-robot-humanoide-de-tesla-que-hara-tareas-peligrosas-y-que-tiene-la-intencion-de-ser-amigable-5026590/</a></figcaption></figure><p>On March 10, Google annouced PaLM-E. A new generalist robotics model that transfers knowledge from varied visual and language domains to a robotics system. This is where things start to heat up and touches on the robot distopia I mentioned at the start. Don\u2019t get me wrong, we are no-where close (and it actually excites me more than fear)\u2026but it\u2019s incredible to no longer just see text or image based output. Now with the help of robotics, the AI can interact with the \u2018real\u2019 world by manipulating objects, solving physical tasks and answering questions.</p><p>Combine this level of intelligence with the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-e1_QhJ1EhQ\">technology from Boston Dynamics</a> and robot butlers and armies are a lot closer than you think!</p><blockquote>Technically, PaLM-E works by injecting observations into a pre-trained language model. This is realized by transforming sensor data, e.g., images, into a representation through a procedure that is comparable to how words of natural language are processed by a language model.<a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2023/03/palm-e-embodied-multimodal-language.html\">AI Google Blog</a></blockquote><p>There is still a lot to be done here and although the current applications are outstanding, the videos are significantly sped up. However, as we\u2019ve seen over the past 6 months, development is now happening at a lightning pace. Who know\u2019s what\u2019s coming next?</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://thethirdblogdata.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/palm-e.jpeg?w=1024\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1847\" height=\"1329\"></figure><p>On top of this, we should also mention the ongoing work at Tesla with their Optimus Robot. One thing you can\u2019t deny are the executions from this company. Often there is a lot of talk about what can be done and the possibilities of new technology \u2013 Tesla is getting stuff done. They have pushed the limits and continue to push products out into the market that cater to the tech-heads and environment enthusiasts. What\u2019s great about these products is that they\u2019re also fun. There is a \u2018cool\u2019 aspect to the brand and we can\u2019t discredit them from the AI Race.</p><p>To summarise, the development of AI has seen a surge in interest over the past 6 months, with OpenAI at the forefront of building and planning for AGI (artificial general intelligence). These developments have prompted the development of AI-powered search engines, with Bing now powered by Chat-GPT 4, and Google improving LaMDA. With continued development in robotics, AI\u2019s potential applications in healthcare, education, and robotics remain vast. I\u2019m excited to see where this goes and how I can contribute in the future!</p><p>T3B</p>",

And, let\u2019s be honest, sometimes it feels like we\u2019re up against a dragon that\u2019s just waiting to come and burn down our brand village.</p><p>I recently heard Jordan Peterson say you must, \u201cSlay the dragon in his lair before he comes to your village\u201d. I made a note of it in my journal and thought I\u2019d make a quick post about why it\u2019s so relevant to our industry. It\u2019s all about being proactive instead of reactive, and taking the initiative to tackle problems head-on before they become a threat to our business.</p><blockquote>\u201cSlay the dragon in his lair before he comes to your village\u201dJORDAN PETERSON</blockquote><p>In marketing, the dragon could be anything from a new competitor entering the market to a sudden shift in consumer behaviour or a negative online review. These are the kinds of things that can cause havoc for our brand and make it difficult to bounce back.</p><p>So, how do we slay the dragon in his lair? Well, it\u2019s all about being prepared and doing our research. We need to stay on top of <strong>industry trends</strong>, keep an eye on <strong>what our competitors are doing</strong>, and listen closely to our <strong>customers\u2019 feedback</strong>.</p><p>Of course, it\u2019s not always easy to know where the dragon is lurking. That\u2019s why we need to be creative and think outside the box. Maybe it\u2019s launching a new marketing campaign before our competitors have a chance to respond, or finding new ways to engage with our customers before they start looking elsewhere.</p><p>At the end of the day, the key is to be proactive and take control of the situation before it takes control of us. As a marketing leader, I know that slaying the dragon in his lair might not always be possible.

      "content_html": "<p>This week I have been cultivating a bunch of new habits \u2013 or maybe more like returning to the ones I found have worked for me over the years. It\u2019s funny how when things are good for us, they so easily fall to the wayside. Anyway, part of this is my morning routine and waking up a bit earlier. I changed myself into an early riser about 6 years ago, but recently I\u2019ve just been wasting that time. I convinced myself some alone time in the morning was great for my health and wellbeing, but actually I was just sat there watching YouTube or playing mobile games.</p><p>With the mornings and some actual focus, I\u2019ve had a lot of new thinking time. I wrote a blog months ago about creating more and consuming less. I also wrote about how my stutter, although limiting, encourages me to write more. I love it and thought, lets combine the two; creation and writing. Let\u2019s get into it.</p><p>First of all, <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/prototyping\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">what is prototyping</a>?</p><p>Protoyping is the process of creating a preliminary version or model of a product, service, or system in order to test and refine its functionality, design, and usability. It typically involves using various materials and tools to create a physical or digital representation of the final product or service. Prototyping is often used in fields such as engineering, product design, software development, and architecture. It allows for early feedback, iteration, and improvements to be made before the final product is produced, which can save time, money, and resources in the long run.</p><p>The interesting thing here is that \u2018<em>prototyping is often used in fields such as engineering, product design, software development, and architecure</em>\u2019.</p><p>Why just these professions?</p><p>One of the main advantages of prototyping is <strong>the ability to identify potential problems or issues at an early stage</strong>. By creating a scaled-down or simplified version of a product or concept, you can test its functionality, usability, and overall viability. Throughout my career I\u2019ve gradually seen the value of prototyping in EVERY profession. Here is why:</p><p><strong>Execution</strong></p><p>Getting stuff done is the cornerstone to success. Something I\u2019ve witnessed throughout my life is that most people are all talk no action. It\u2019s a stream of BS that lines the mouths of friends and coworkers; trying to look busy and trying to look important. What I have consistently tried to focus on is execution. Every day, every week, every month \u2013 what can I contribute and what can I launch?</p><p>There is HUGE value in getting things done. A prototype will do that for you. A prototype shows yourself, your team and your superiors that things ARE in motion. In complex projects, there are often some tasks that seem unsourmountable. Break these down and deliver a first draft. Remember, a prototype doesn\u2019t JUST need to be a product. Write down some ideas, visualise the scenario or the campaign and share it with people. Just like this blog, it can be used as a mirror and a sounding-board to continue the momentum and gain valuable feedback.</p><blockquote>Tony Robbins says \u201c<em>It\u2019s not about success, it\u2019s about progress\u2026Progress equals happiness</em>\u201d.</blockquote><p>Prototyping can also instill confidence in stakeholders, as they can see and interact with a tangible representation of the final product or solution. This hands-on experience can help alleviate concerns and uncertainties, leading to quicker decision-making and faster project approval.</p><p><strong>Communication &amp; Instant Feedback</strong></p><p>In particular, prototyping allows complex tasks to be simplified, and it can help teams to communicate more clearly. A prototype provides the advantages of visualizing ideas, as well as the ability to refine and adjust the design along the way.</p><p>Perfectionism stains the minds of so many great thinkers. We refuse to share an unfinished project due to fear of reprisal, shame and being wrong. Elon Musk has a great quote that says \u201c<em>Failure is essentially irrelevant unless it is catastrophic</em>.\u2019. Sharing your work in business is invaluable. Even if you are the \u2018big boss\u2019, gathering feedback from those that will have some involvement in the deliverable is invaluable.</p><p>I work in marketing. As soon as you can share some visuals, budget, expected return, WHATEVER \u2013 with the product teams, sales team or your boss \u2013 the better. Before you\u2019ve had time to invest HOURS making the \u2018perfect\u2019 deliverable \u2013 get some feedback. Test it out on a smaller scale. Communicate your plans with the team and see what they say.</p><p>Something that took me a long time to understand is that you can\u2019t do everything alone, no matter how much you try. In business, have you ever heard someone say you communicated TOO much? I doubt it. Put your prototype out to the world and see what happens. BEST case scenario, you get some early feedback from some key stakeholders and also keep them in the loop.</p><p><strong>Testing &amp; Data Gathering</strong></p><p>By exploring different ways that professionals use prototyping, it is possible to uncover the unique benefits that it offers to professionals in different fields.</p><p>How often have you worked on a big project, presented your ideas and then been tactically shot-down by the room? Maybe you haven\u2019t been in this scenario and everything has been a breeze \u2013 but testing with prototypes would make this even easier. Imagine if you had data to back up your ideas? Data to backup your campaigns? This is how you stand out from the rest. How do you get data at the start of a project? Develop a prototype.</p><p>For example, prototyping can be used to quickly test different versions of marketing campaigns, or to rapidly develop and deploy computer programs. For marketing teams, a prototype can help to assess the performance of campaigns and make quick adjustments to maximize results.</p><p>One time I created a prototype for a JOB INTERVIEW. I was asked to make a small presentation on their products and give them my thoughts on their marketing strategy (Free labour/ cheeky for a job interview right?..anyway). I put some ideas to paper and shared it with 100 people through friends and family. What did I have to show and present during the interview? INVALUABLE feedback from real-world users about their product. Something that to be honest their team should already of had\u2026 but did I get the job? You bet I did.</p><p>This shows the value of <strong>Execution</strong>, <strong>Instant feedback</strong> and <strong>Data gathering</strong> \u2013 let\u2019s continue:</p><p><strong>Cost &amp; Time Savings</strong></p><p>There are also potential cost savings associated with prototyping. With a prototype, teams can quickly build a product idea, measure the impact, and move on to a commercial product more quickly. This results in faster development, lower costs, and a better overall customer experience.</p><p>Additionally, prototyping allows you to identify potential problems or issues at an early stage. By creating a scaled-down or simplified version of a product or concept, you can test its functionality, usability, and overall viability. This early detection allows you to address problems before they become costly and time-consuming to fix later in the development process.</p><p>Regardless of your profession, prototyping offers numerous benefits that can save both time and money. By enabling early identification of issues, improved decision-making, iterative development, reduced waste, increased stakeholder confidence, and enhanced collaboration, prototyping is a valuable tool that should not be overlooked in any field.</p><p>I hope this has been useful!</p><p>T3B</p>",

I\u2019m interested to see how this will impact my journey into machine learning and discover if a \u2018formal education\u2019 gives me a better foundation to \u00a0re-launch into a new career.</p><p>The biggest thing I\u2019m hoping to get from this is some structure. You can see from the rest of the blogs that my self-education has been somewhat sporadic. I jumped straight into coding and bypassed all the theory. Some might argue this is the better approach and it can all be self taught\u2026however regardless of the content, there is still good-value in a formal qualification. Further to this, I\u2019m studying because I want to and thankfully not under immense pressure to find immediate employment. Being able to return to university in my 30\u2019s and keep learning new skills is a fortunate and exciting thing. Let\u2019s get it!</p><p>11 Modules that span; algorithms and data structures, advanced programming, big data analytics, machine learning and applied AI. Also, opportunities at each stage to practice my new skills and knowledge. I read a lot before enrolling about the expectations vs reality of a Computer Science degree. Many think you learn to code but its actually a small part of the sllyabus and most students just choose to learn it alongside their studies. Coding is involved but it\u2019s the theory you study.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0GlqFrRQI0&amp;t=448s\">Tech Lead</a> on YouTube compares a cmputer science degree and coding to a photographer. As a photograher you probably want to learn about all the settings on your camera, how to frame a shot, lighting, etc. Instead, they\u2019ll teach you to build the camera. It\u2019s foundational knowledge, not objective, practical skills. I\u2019m alright with that.</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://code.org/learn/computer-science\">code.org</a>, this is their definition:</p><p>Computer Science is the study of the theoretical foundations of information and computation and their application in computer systems. It involves the design, development, and analysis of algorithms, software, and hardware to solve complex problems and enable technological advancements. Computer Science encompasses various fields such as artificial intelligence, data science, cybersecurity, networking, and software engineering. It plays a critical role in shaping modern society and revolutionizing industries.</p><p>Having said this, I now find myself in week 1 learning Java. In my intital coding research over a year ago, Java was a langauge not particularly in high demand. We\u2019ll see what the course material is like, but it could be a good time to return to codecademy. It definately had it\u2019s benefits and for a crash course in Java, could be a great option.</p><p>Either way, we\u2019re here at the bottom of the mountain. This will be an intersting two years and i\u2019m excited to see where it goes.</p><p>T3B</p>",

      "content_html": "<p>I started a project back in November to read a book a month for 12 months. I got off to a great start and consistently worked my way through the first 4 books on the plan. THEN\u2026I found Blinkist and I was able to digest a new book almost every morning. It has it\u2019s pros and cons, but for a man than predominantly reads non-fiction, it\u2019s the perfect accompaniment to my morning coffee.</p><p>Something that interested me this week was the concept of the \u2018Cathedral Effect\u2019. It\u2019s mentioned in Tiago Forte\u2019s book, Building a Second Brain and I was curious how to apply this myself.</p><p><strong>What is the Cathedral Effect?</strong></p><p>\u201c<em>The Cathedral Effect is a term used to describe a workspace that has the grandeur and majesty of a cathedral. This can be achieved through careful design and attention to details such as the arrangement of the furniture, the color of the walls, and the type of decorations, such as artwork and plants. The main idea behind this concept is for the workspace to evoke a feeling of serenity and awe to help motivate and inspire productivity. By creating a space that reflects one\u2019s personality and interests, it can create a comfortable and productive environment and lead to greater focus and productivity.</em>\u201d \u2013 Chat GPT</p><p>Have you ever noticed how some workspaces seem to almost have a life of their own? Like you\u2019re entering some type of sacred space? That feeling is what we call the Cathedral Effect.</p><p>When we think of a cathedral, the most striking feature is the sheer beauty of its grandeur design and size. Whether it\u2019s the arrangement of the stained-glass windows or the shape of the arches, all of the careful details come together to create an atmosphere that is both serene and awe-inspiring.</p><p>This same concept of majesty and grandeur can be applied to your workspace and something I\u2019ve been working on for some time. I\u2019m a gadget man and always looking for the best desk setup. Your environment, tools, ambience, lighting, textures, smells \u2013 it\u2019s all a part of the overall design. It\u2019s no wonder that many people, when feeling overwhelmed by their work, look for solace and a peaceful place to focus where it feels like their productivity will magically increase.</p><p>When you have a workspace that feels like a cathedral, it can help you stay motivated and connected to the task that you\u2019re working on. Creating a space that you love to be in and that inspires productivity is essential for any workspace, and that\u2019s what the Cathedral Effect is all about. There\u2019s an ongoing debate about \u2018return to the office\u2019 at the moment. Many people have been able to create small \u2018Cathedrals\u2019 at home, and there is very little a standard office can replicate.</p><p>For example, at home \u2013 I have a corner view office with amazing natural light. I love nature so I\u2019m surrounded by plants and work from a custom oak stand-up desk. I have artwork that I love, an ergonomic chair and a 32\u201d curved screen to manage my team and my work. I have my Yamaha piano close by to relieve stress throughout the day and a balcony with fresh air for a change of scenery. Add to this my own fridge and own toilet\u2026it\u2019s a dream.</p><p>Compare this to the \u2018Cathedral\u2019 of the office \u2013 I have a desk and chair in a room of 10. No personalisation, no privacy, no where to go and think. We share a bathroom with 14 and a kitchen with the same. No plants, conflicting temperature needs and restricted light.</p><p>This isn\u2019t an argument for or against the office. It\u2019s just an exaggerated comparison of the two \u2018Cathedrals\u2019. One is very conducive to my working needs, one is not. It\u2019s understandable\u2026but the fact there is a \u2018concept\u2019 for this, is interesting to me.</p><p>Whether you\u2019re working from home or in an office, creating a workspace with the Cathedral Effect is a great way to stay focused and motivated. Take the time to design a space that fits your personality and interests, and watch how your productivity soars.</p><p>On the other hand AND a total contradiction to this post is a concept from stoic philosophy. Forget your \u2018Cathedral\u2019 and focus on what you can control.</p><p>Your mind.</p><p>Do what works for you. Remember, it could be a combination of the two! \ud83d\ude09</p><p><em>\u201cThe chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control.

      "content_html": "<p>Time is your most valuable resource, so make sure you make the most of it. Write down your goals, be selective with your commitments, and take care of yourself.</p><p>Recently lots of people have been demanding my time\u2026 For so long I\u2019ve been focusing on productivity and the relentless pursuit of optimising my day. However, this made me sit back and think. Sometimes control and peace comes from subtraction rather than doing more. The opportunity to be hyper focused on a select few goals rather than responding to every request.</p><p>I realised I was doing too much and therefore had opportunity to sit back, analyse and refocus.</p><p>The first step for me is to prioritize. I\u2019m setting aside time to focus on my top three goals, and creating a plan to help me reach them. I\u2019m also making time for things that bring me joy and excitement, like maintaining my blog, playing piano and making time for myself. The peace, tranquility and isolation of the early mornings is theraputic and something I should prioritise above all. Having some time carved out every morning to attend to my own needs has proven invaluable as the day quickly fills up with work and other commitments.</p><p>Maintaining a blog and making a commitment to voicing my opinion online is something that is still very attractive to me. \u2018Show your work\u2019 had such a profound effect on my approach to sharing that I continue to maintain this site. Setting the time aside to make sure that this becomes a reality is very important and something I plan to focus on much more over the coming months. Part of managing time is doing things that bring excitement, joy, and feel rewarding. Making time for this is invaluable.</p><p>Another key to using time efficiently is to learn how to say no. If someone comes to you with something that doesn\u2019t align with your goals, it\u2019s perfectly ok to say no. Of course, in certain cases you won\u2019t have a choice about your commitments and you do need to juggle multiple tasks. But if you\u2019re consciously aware of what you\u2019re committing to and how much of it contributes to the big picture, you can prioritize accordingly and get the most out of your time.</p><p>Finally, practice self-care and listen to your body. It\u2019s important to take a break and re-energize if you want to make the most of your time. This can look different for everyone but the idea is to make sure your mind, body and soul are taken care of. Whether it\u2019s taking a yoga class, going for a walk in nature, or just curling up with a warm cup of tea, carving out a few minutes for yourself can make a world of difference.</p><p>These are some quick notes on my experiences this year. Again, it\u2019s pretty raw and imperfect\u2026but that\u2019s how it should be. Have a good week!</p><p>T3B</p>",

Mathematics and statistics seems to be a HUGE part of what it takes to succeed in this industry, so I thought I\u2019d start there.</p>\n<p>The past few months I\u2019ve read the following books:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Introduction to Statistics</strong></li><li><strong>Algorithms to Live by, </strong>Brian Christian [<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25666050-algorithms-to-live-by\">Goodreads</a>]</li><li>Started the <strong>Calculus</strong> path on Brilliant [<a href=\"https://brilliant.org/courses/calculus-nutshell/\">Brilliant Calculus</a>]</li><li>Daily Algebra Problems</li><li><strong>CodeWars</strong> Daily Challenge [<a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/users/JazW\">JazW | Codewars</a>]</li></ul>\n<p>This year seems to have been a HUGE step forwards in terms of how AI and ML is impacting our lives. The likes of Mid Journey and more recently Chat GPT are set to revolutionise the world and I\u2019ve found some very cool ways to implement these features in my new day-to-day workflow. (Another blog to follow). This is super exciting and was enough to reignite my love of this amazing new tech.</p>\n<p>I want to revisit my journey and get back on track. After delving back into mathematics and statistics \u2013 albeit very basic at this stage \u2013 I have opted for the [<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/\">Machine Learning Specialization \u2013 DeepLearning.AI</a>], by Andrew Ng.</p>\n<p>I am 4 weeks in and already enjoying the different approach. It\u2019s quite math-heavy to what I\u2019m used to, but it\u2019s VERY interesting. The best part? \u2013 Week 2 had a project to build a Linear Regression model and I thought I\u2019d also try it off-platform to see how I could implement this into my own project / make sure I had the tools setup correctly.</p>\n<p>I had some issues setting up my python again, but I\u2019ve documented the quick fix here [<a href=\"https://www.thethirdblog.com/post/how-i-fixed-my-python-install\">Fixing your python install</a>]. Info was spread all over the internet and it\u2019s nice to have it in one place. So let\u2019s get started:</p>\n<blockquote>What is supervised machine learning?</blockquote>\n<p><em>Explanation provided by CHAT GPT:</em></p>\n<p>Supervised machine learning is a type of machine learning algorithm that uses labeled data to train a model to make predictions. The model is trained on a set of labeled data, which contains both input features and output labels. The model is then tested on a set of unseen data to see how accurately it can predict the output labels\u2026</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-project\">The Project</h2>\n<p>The aim of this project was to create a supervised prediction model to calculate house sale profits in the US, based on population of city. This was so you could input the population of your city and receive an /idea/ of what you could sell your house for. Sounds simple enough\u2026</p>\n<p>Python isn\u2019t completely new to me, so I was able to follow, write and understand a lot of the code. We import datasets, run some analysis on the \u2019.shape\u2019 of the data, then use matplotlib to visualise it. The steps I followed are documented below:</p>\n<p><strong>IDE</strong>: Visual Studio Code</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1</strong>. First I import the necessary libraries; <strong>numpy</strong>, <strong>matplotlib</strong>, <strong>math</strong> and <strong>copy</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2</strong>. Next, I built out a dataset. The course provided some dummy data for use in the Jupyter notebook, but I recreated the dataset using a numpy array. Let\u2019s say we have two variables (x1 and x2) \u2013 you can set it up the following way:</p>\n<p>x1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])<br>x2 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3</strong>. After this, it\u2019s time to create the linear regression model and fit it to our data.</p>\n<p>This is where things got fun as I had to calculate both of these variables and translate them to code. The following image shows a nice summary of the formula needed (It\u2019ll no doubt take some time to fully understand what is going on here\u2026but hey it\u2019s an ongoing process and I\u2019m just at the start!):</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://thethirdblogdata.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/273c3-09afff_2d7c0a687572481a9ea079bde5bd0c05mv2.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n<p>Essentially, I will summarise Linear Regression like this:</p>\n<blockquote>Linear Regression = fitting a straight line to your data</blockquote>\n<p>The <strong>goal of linear regression</strong> is to use the cost function to find the value of w AND b that minimizes J</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4</strong>. Plotting the original data and then the regression model to a scatter graph:</p>\n<p>This part was super cool! I\u2019ve done some <a href=\"https://www.thethirdblog.com/post/matplotlib-turning-code-to-colour\">basic work with matplotlib</a> in the past, but using it as part of a real project makes it 10x more fun. You can see immediately how running this type of analysis on a larger dataset would be incredibly useful.</p>\n<p>Something fun I learnt was adjusting how the points are plotted using the \u2018marker\u2019 and \u2018c\u2019 attributes. In this case it represents a RED \u2018X\u2019.</p>\n<p># Create a scatter plot of the data. <br>plt.scatter(x_train, y_train, marker=\u2018x\u2019, c=\u2018r\u2019) </p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://thethirdblogdata.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/0819b-09afff_c62dd9c36b624416a35c690ad62aca24mv2.webp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Original Dataset\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n<p><strong>Step 5</strong>.

Often, there are many more factors to consider such as sq. foot, amenities in the area, number of bathrooms etc. For this a different model will be needed.</p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t my best blog, but I wanted to get something out and \u2018on paper\u2019. Recreating this assignment off-platform was actually SUPER useful for me and a great exercise to better understand the process. I had to setup my local python environment AND I went through the code again line by line.</p>\n<p>No doubt i\u2019ll have to revisit this module at some point but for now we move onto classification models and logistic regression!</p>\n<p>T3B</p>\n<p></p>",

      "content_html": "<p>So, as I\u2019ve been working through the Data Scientist career path on Codecademy (<em>for some solid fundamentals</em>), I skipped ahead to the first off-platform portfolio project. There was a lot of overlap at the start of the course on Python basics (I\u2019m comfortable enough to not go through this again), so I thought I would learn the rest as I went along and fill any gaps.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m placing a focus on off-platform work as this will most closely match any day to day work I get in a real job. I also need to be as comfortable with these Python tools as possible and not rely on the Codecademy interface. This post will document my process:</p>\n<p><strong>Day 1 \u2013 Project Scope and plan of action</strong></p>\n<p>The aim of the project is to take a raw CSV file containing medical insurance payout information, manipulate the data into something readable, analyse it and draw some conclusions. I currently work in the medical field so this is actually something that I can see happening in a business. After reviewing the data, there are over a thousand rows of; client age, sex, bmi, children, smoker (y/n), region and charges on the account.</p>\n<p>For the sake of tracking my progress I identified 5 objectives for the data:</p>\n<ol><li><strong>Average age of client</strong> <em>(Let\u2019s ease myself into this with an easy one)</em></li><li><strong>How do the number of children impact the client profile?</strong></li><li><strong>Charges per area</strong> <em>(I might be able to visualise this nicely with <a href=\"https://www.thethirdblog.com/post/matplotlib-turning-code-to-colour\"><em>MatPlotLib</em></a>)</em></li><li><strong>Which gender has the highest charges? </strong><em>(Then I might be able to break this down into age bracket)</em></li><li><strong>Average age of client with 1 child or more</strong>. (This kind of data could be used when targeting new customers online etc)</li></ol>\n<p>Immediately, this has identified some areas that I need to brush up on; <strong>Using the mac terminal</strong>, working in <strong>Jupyter Notebooks</strong>, maybe <strong>classes?</strong>, working <strong>with files</strong> and <strong>manipulating data with pandas</strong>. Looks like a lot \u2013 let\u2019s get started.</p>\n<h2 id=\"using-the-mac-terminal\">Using the Mac Terminal.</h2>\n<p>I\u2019d already installed the necessary files last year, so to launch a new notebook you just put:</p>\n<p># Launch a new Notebook<br>jupyter notebook# Lists what is in the current folder<br>ls# Opens a [folder_name]<br>cd [folder_name]</p>\n<h2 id=\"working-in-jupyter-notebooks\">Working in Jupyter Notebooks</h2>\n<p>Installing and opening jupyter is the hardest part of this. Once you are in the tool it\u2019s quite self explanatory and very convenient. I also have PyCharm installed which allows me to code locally but this platform is a lot more accessible.</p>\n<p>Day 2 \u2013 Concept Review</p>\n<h2 id=\"classes-revision\">Classes Revision</h2>\n<p>Reviewing old topics and working through the advanced python course on DataCamp, I was always having trouble with classes. Similar to the way loops confused me at the start, it\u2019s now the same with this. I had to go right back and review this from the beginning and it wasn\u2019t easy.</p>\n<p>I now understand how to build out classes with correct structure, but this was in a managed curriculum setting. Going forward it will be important to understand when and how to best use these within my own code. I can follow along with a guide, but implementing these myself will be the challenge. It\u2019s also going to take time to learn the correct class syntax. I have notes now but it\u2019s disheartening every time I need to look it up. I know this will come with time \u2013 understanding the WHEN/ HOW is more important for now.</p>\n<p>To begin, <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/enhance-your-python-project-code-with-classes-5a19d0e9f841#:~:text=A%20Python%20class%20is%20like,object%20is%20initiated%20from%20scratch\">towards_data_science</a> has a nice explanation of what a class is:</p>\n<blockquote>A Python class is like an outline for creating a new object. An object is anything that you wish to manipulate or change while working through the code. Every time a class object is instantiated, which is when we declare a variable, a new object is initiated from scratch. Class objects can be used over and over again whenever needed.</blockquote>\n<p>Codecademy has a nice <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-science/tracks/dscp-python-fundamentals/modules/dscp-python-classes/cheatsheet\">classes cheatsheet</a> that I can refer to here. It will definately be worth doing some addition practice exercises on this before I proceed past this project.</p>\n<h2 id=\"working-with-files\">Working with files</h2>\n<p>Working with files and scraping data from the web is one of the most exciting parts for me. It\u2019s an easy way to see how my new python skills can be used in the \u2018real\u2019 world environment. Due to my professional background, I\u2019ve always been comfortable in a spreadsheet so these skills tie together very well. Part of this project involves downloading, formatting and analysing a CSV file, so I needed to revise this topic.</p>\n<p>\u2026after doing some revision here, I\u2019ve been able to import and view the content of the CSV file. First problem solved, now onto the next one. How can I manipulate this data into lists or dictionaries that I can use? <em>This I believe is where Pandas come in.</em> I think I can use them to move around and structure the data as I\u2019d like. Then with NumPy (numerical python) to make calculations and MatPlotLib to visualise it. But\u2026I can also do the first part of this with normal lists too.</p>\n<p><strong>#import the insurance costs CSV file</strong><br>import csv<br>with open(\"insurance.csv\") as insurance_raw:<br>    insurance_raw = csv.DictReader(insurance_raw)<br>    for row in insurance_raw:<br>        print(row)</p>\n<p>Although I remember Pandas from a previous course \u2013 the track hasn\u2019t actually covered this topic yet. There must be a way I can disseminate this data using the concepts I\u2019m already familiar with so I\u2019m going to look a little deeper \u2013 If this fails, i\u2019ll keep investigating my way and see where it goes\u2026</p>\n<p><em>\u2026a few hours later</em></p>\n<p>I was able to iterate through the spreadsheet and .append the info I needed into a new python list. For ages I had issues making calculations on the list until I realised I needed to convert the age strings to integers. I was able to do this with a list comprehension and then proceed. From here, it was simple math to calculate the average age:</p>\n<p>average_age_of_client = sum(age_of_client_int) / len(age_of_client_int)</p>\n<p><strong>OBJECTIVE ONE: Average age of client</strong>: 39. DONE</p>\n<p>Day 3 \u2013 Digging into file manipulation</p>\n<p>The next step was to do the same \u2018data export\u2019 but with different data points; in this case <em>number of children</em> and <em>total amount of charges</em>. I skipped ahead of my plan slightly, but chose to try and plot this information visually using MatPlotLib. I had to come off jupyter notebooks and into PyCharm for this as I couldn\u2019t figure out how to import the library.</p>\n<p>After combining two lists into a dictionary, then manipulating the data types from strings &gt; floats &gt; ints, (<em>this sounds like a breeze, but it actually took me hours to realise the problem!</em>) I was able to plot some basic charts. I looked at scatter diagrams and bar charts to see what would display the best and opted on this with some fancy formatting:</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://thethirdblogdata.files.wordpress.com/2022/04/ed8ae-09afff_ec352a9242194a8b87162dec281379c3mv2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n<h3 id=\"verification\">Verification</h3>\n<p>After looking into the data manually to check some out my output and verify my code, there was a problem. My list: dictionary comprehension (after converting both to INT lists wasn\u2019t operating as expected). Individually, the lists were correct. As a dictionary, they were not. <strong>It turns out I did everything wrong.</strong></p>\n<p>List1: [0,1,3,0,0,0,1,3,2, ...]<br>List2: [16884, 1725, 4449, 2194, 3866, ...]<br>Dict1: {0:<strong>29141</strong>, 1:<strong>9377</strong>, 3:<strong>10600</strong>, ...] <br><br>#it looks like the key is correct, but the value is wrong</p>\n<p>After some investigation and some help from the friendly users on the <a href=\"https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/zipped-dict-random-numbers/665432\">Codecademy forum</a>, I realised <strong>dictionaries need a unique key</strong> and are <strong>unordered</strong>. As a result, my new dictionary was only 5 keys long; data for 0 \u2013 5 children \u2013 each instance overwriting the last. What a mess\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Onto the fix:</strong> I defined a new function that would iterate and count through my child list then add a running total to one_child, two_child, three_child etc attributes. I could then combine this with a simple [0,1,2,3,4,5] (number of children) list to create the dictionary of my dreams. This shows number of kids as the key and a count of clients with those kids as the value. Just what I need for my chart!</p>\n<p>{0: 574, 1: 324, 2: 240, 3: 157, 4: 25, 5: 18}</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://thethirdblogdata.files.wordpress.com/2022/04/9b405-09afff_61fbd2ea566e4dc8bb004a9f03c5a073mv2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n<blockquote>In hindsight, the analysis of these data points is pretty basic and arguably useless\u2026 However, objective 2 has taught me a LOT of valuable lessons. I need a LOT more practice implementing python basics and a LOT of practice writing more condensed and simplified code.</blockquote>\n<p>OBJECTIVE TWO: <strong>How do the number of children impact the client profile? DONE</strong></p>\n<p><strong>As you can see from the graph, the less children you have, the greater chance you\u2019ll have to be a client. Most of the users have zero children (which may be most profitable for the business)</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>Today I was humbled and there is a lot I need to review. This is hours of work with very little to show. I could complete this entire project in excel in 20 minutes. The problem solving is bliss to me, I really enjoy it. However I need to spend more time mastering the fundamentals so it\u2019s less about wishing with code and more about planning my overall approach then executing.</p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t even realise that dictionaries had to have unique keys and this threw me off for a long time trying to find a solution.</p>\n<p>As a result, i\u2019m going to stop this project here while I review some more of the fundamentals. I will continue my Data Scientist course on codecademy but keep coding off platform as much as possible. I found a super cool site called <a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/\">codewars</a> that might be a good place to start.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading.</p>\n<p>T3B</p>\n<p></p>",

      "content_html": "<p>This blog post was originally titled ChatBots\u2026but I soon realised there was a LOT more to unpack than I first imagined. It\u2019s definitely a topic that needs to be broken down, so let\u2019s start with the 3 different types: <strong>rule-based chatbots</strong>, retrieval-based chatbots and deep-learning/ generative chatbots (fig3). The last is something I\u2019m aspiring to, but let\u2019s follow the process and learn the basics first.</p>\n<p>For reference, I am following the <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/build-chatbots-with-python\">Build Chatbots with Python</a> path on Codecademy.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll be honest \u2013 things started to get really complicated and I had to take it super slow to get a solid understanding of the concepts. Either way, I got through this section, made some fancy notes and have started my own off-platform build. Super cool stuff!</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://thethirdblogdata.files.wordpress.com/2022/04/8c15c-09afff_97897fa008b84cdd9db34e1258f983e2mv2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n<p>Building an <strong><em>if this then that</em></strong> style bot is actually pretty simple. Once you understand the syntax you can keep adding new rules and processes to create the system you want. Small snippets of code is one thing, but as you start to build out programs I\u2019ve found it VERY useful to annotate with <a href=\"https://manage.wix.com/dashboard/1288440a-1d4f-4988-869b-e9d23ae19c05/blog/posts/search/.hash.comments?referralInfo=sidebar\">#comments</a> as things can get confusing and fast!</p>\n<p>I am working on perfecting a coffee ordering system that hopefully I can share with the blog soon enough. (<em>I may have to figure out GitHub which is probably a whole project in itself\u2026</em>)</p>\n<p>Essentially you can plan this type of chatbot in a huge decision tree then code out all the responses. Sprout Social have a similar \u2018<a href=\"https://support.sproutsocial.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003059703-Bot-Builder\">bot-builder</a>\u2018 function that i\u2019ve used in the past. It\u2019s also in a nice GUI (graphical user interface) to make it more accessible. In the future this could also be a nice little side project.</p>\n<h2 id=\"text-preprocessing\">Text Preprocessing</h2>\n<p>Where things started to get REALLY interesting was learning how to preprocess text! What\u2019s great about this is I can scrape content from a webpage, pull data from a API, even <strong>input via voice recognition;</strong> process it so it can be read by a computer and then return a result. This is almost a mini-alexa style bot and is super exciting.</p>\n<p>Before I get into some of the process, here are my notes on this topic:</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://thethirdblogdata.files.wordpress.com/2023/01/1.webp?w=1024\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2220\" height=\"1570\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://thethirdblogdata.files.wordpress.com/2023/01/2.webp?w=1024\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2220\" height=\"1570\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://thethirdblogdata.files.wordpress.com/2023/01/3.webp?w=1024\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2124\" height=\"1502\"></figure>\n<p>Essentially, breaking down any text into a format we can read requires a few different steps. To execute any of this requires the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) platform. An explanation of which can be found on their site, <a href=\"https://www.nltk.org/\">nltk.org</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to <a href=\"https://www.nltk.org/nltk_data/\">over 50 corpora and lexical resources</a> such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries, and an active <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/group/nltk-users\">discussion forum</a>.</blockquote>\n<p>All of these steps are known as <strong>Text Preprocessing</strong> and involve some of the following:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Noise Removal</strong> \u2013 This is exactly what it sounds like and involves removing any \u2018crap\u2019 that comes along with scraped text. This could be HTML tags, formatting markup, quotation marks etc.</li></ul>\n<p>As an example, after importing <strong>re</strong>, we can run the following to remove all H1 tags in a text:</p>\n<pre><code>re.sub(r\"&lt;.?H1&gt;\", \"\", variable_string)</code></pre>\n<p>The r is required to indicate RAW text.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Tokenization*</strong> \u2013 This is the process of breaking up a large volume of text into manageable words (word.tokenize) or sentences (sent.tokenize). These are referred to as tokens.</li></ul>\n<p>After importing tokenize, you can call the function using the following:</p>\n<pre><code>from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nvariable = word_tokenize(variable_string)</code></pre>\n<p>This creates a new variable that tokenizes the content from variable_string.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Normalization*</strong> \u2013 described best from Codecademy: In natural language processing, <em>normalization</em> encompasses many text preprocessing tasks including stemming, lemmatization, upper or lowercasing, and stopwords removal.</li></ul>\n<p>Checkout my notes for a deeper look into various normalization techniques. I plan to use all of these features in my off-site build.</p>\n<p>Many of these normalization features allow you to give greater meaning to some parts of the text and eliminate the \u2018filler words\u2019. This is super useful when you need to disseminate and analyse user input. It\u2019s also very useful for validation.</p>\n<p><em>*Side note \u2013 the american english spelling of these words really frustrates me.</em></p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://thethirdblogdata.files.wordpress.com/2022/04/6569b-09afff_943477940da041a18ee055c9d80a16b1mv2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n<p>I\u2019ve included the above chart as reference for the future. Currently i\u2019m working on a rule-based, closed domain chatbot built on a simple dialog tree. The end goal is to build a generative, open domain, AI powered bot.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m only half way through this bot-building course on Codecademy so no doubt it gets into the more complex stuff. Writing my notes alongside these review posts is working great in terms of understanding the concepts.</p>\n<p>Hopefully it helps!</p>\n<p>T3B</p>\n<p></p>",

I will direct people off a topic if there are words I can\u2019t say and i\u2019ll also direct them into something that\u2019s easier to articulate. If that sounds exhausting, it is.</p>\n<p>As a result of this, my vocabulary is extensive and I put immense value on the significance of every word. Perhaps this explains the presentation : pizza conundrum. Meticulous practice for a presentation or speech puts my mind at ease and I will test every combination of words beforehand to ensure a smooth delivery. For example, if i\u2019m having a rough day, it\u2019s easy for me to swap the word direction, with route or path. If i\u2019m ordering a pizza (or any food for that matter) and I want mushrooms BUT I can\u2019t say it \u2013 i\u2019ll order something else! This might sound crazy to some of you but it\u2019s a reality for myself and many others. I have this problem asking for \u2018water\u2019 ALL the time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-challenges-of-stuttering\">The challenges of stuttering</h2>\n<p>So asides from ordering what I can say rather than what I want \u2013 what other odd experiences can I have throughout the day? Well, I\u2019m glad you asked:</p>\n<p>If I block, I will pretend I\u2019ve forgotten the word instead. A quick \u2018ah what\u2019s it called?\u2019 is often enough time to think of another or get assistance from your conversation partner. It\u2019s weird, but for me, just hearing someone else say a word instantly allows me to say it. It\u2019s almost as if my brain can no longer formulate the sounds without imitation.</p>\n<p>I like to think of myself as an intelligent person so I don\u2019t always appreciate having to do this. When you know the answer but have to pretend you don\u2019t to emulate fluency, it can be a little disheartening. Humour is also something I love. This often requires quick reflexes and perfect timing. Having a stutter can limit the amount of punchlines I can deliver publically, but I\u2019ll often have a little giggle to myself instead.</p>\n<p><em>My closest friends and family will always help me if I\u2019m struggling with a word. This is a very personal thing, but for me it\u2019s a relief if someone I know steps in to \u2018ease the pain\u2019. Don\u2019t just do this though. Make sure the person is comfortable first.</em></p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://thethirdblogdata.files.wordpress.com/2022/04/57ce0-76903f8e1cbb42c58d4335bf5bccef66.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n<p>Calligraphy is a new hobby of mine. A way to make written words even more beautiful.</p>\n<p>If I meet someone that loves to speak, I\u2019ll let them. <strong>I\u2019m unequivocally fascinated by people that can effortlessly portray the inner workings of their mind.</strong> This is a dream. Many of my closest friends are highly articulate people. I surround myself with them and it\u2019s great inspiration/ research for me. Research might sound like an odd word here, but I try to emulate the good qualities I see in others in myself. Great communication is one of those skills.</p>\n<blockquote>I\u2019m unequivocally fascinated by people that can effortlessly portray the inner workings of their mind.</blockquote>\n<p>It no longer bothers me, but it certainly affects my life. Any stutterer wonders what their life would/ could be like if they could just talk. Extroversion and precise communication is heavily rewarded in current society and it\u2019s easy to feel ostracised when even a \u2018simple\u2019 conversation drains so much energy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"learning-a-new-language\">Learning a new language</h3>\n<p>This is a crazy one and something I think about a lot. After years of fine tuning my coping mechanisms and \u2018perfecting\u2019 my style of speech, I quickly realised it only worked in English. My spanish journey started five years ago, but after I moved to Spain in 2019 I increased my lessons to have a greater quality of life. Also, if you\u2019re going to live in a foreign country, the least you can do is learn some of the language\u2026</p>\n<p>Anyway, speaking a new language is like learning to talk all over again. You have to learn new sounds, phrases, grammar and pronunciation. This becomes very problematic as you start to formulate sentences and only know a limited selection of words. If you don\u2019t know enough vocabulary, you can\u2019t swap words. For me, that\u2019s a serious problem.</p>\n<p>I have persisted but it\u2019s definitely not easy. It\u2019s like another layer on top of an already complex process. If I can\u2019t say \u2018dif\u00edcil\u2019 I can say \u2018no es f\u00e1cil\u2019 and vice versa \u2013 but it\u2019s a lot to manage when there is already a lot to think about. Asking for a \u2018bolsa\u2019 (a bag) in the supermarket is hell\u2026</p>\n<p>In researching this, I found a great article by <a href=\"http://temporaryprovisions.com/what-my-stutter-taught-me-language-learning-traveling/\"><u>Sojourner White</u></a> on just this topic. She said:</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Then I began stuttering over Spanish words, both old and new. I remember stuttering for a solid minute over the words tarjeta de cr\u00e9dito, which is Spanish for \u201ccredit card,\u201d when I wanted to pay for my gelato in Granada. I remember the auras of impatience I received from waiters when I couldn\u2019t order tapas without stuttering from a menu. The social anxiety and uncomfortableness I felt as a kid returned, but the reactions as a young adult with a stutter were a lot less forgiving.</em>\u201c</p>\n<p>This is true as i\u2019ve found often adults don\u2019t quite know how to react. Many times it\u2019s just laughter due to lack of understanding. Either way it certainly can be uncomfortable.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qjv0CLwZWnI?autoplay=0&amp;mute=0&amp;controls=1&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thethirdblog.com&amp;playsinline=1&amp;showinfo=1&amp;rel=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;widgetid=1&amp;version=3&amp;showsearch=0&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">YouTube</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\"></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/favicon.ico\" alt=\"\"></div></div></a></figure>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>One plus side is I\u2019m very specific with my communication and I listen intensely throughout every conversation. I often want to say the least so anything I do say is relevant and objective. This has been invaluable in making friends and forming lasting relationships. I\u2019ve learnt a lot about people as they feel comfortable opening up and sharing their life with me. Listening truly is a great skill.</p>\n<p>Alongside this, my love of writing has always been prevalent in my life. I might not be able to articulate myself verbally, but with written words it\u2019s almost fun. One day I will write a book but for now I\u2019m happy with my blog.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading.</p>\n<p>T3B</p>\n<p></p>",

Part of my activity for this week has been to simplify some of my digital world. There\u2019s so many distractions that a little house-keeping actually went a long way. Let\u2019s get started!</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://thethirdblogdata.files.wordpress.com/2022/04/45097-ce5634d2307b4c27aa12d315b1329394.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n<p></p>\n<p>I will do a separate post on my digital setup \u2013 but essentially i\u2019ve moved everything to the cloud and chosen a few solid apps to keep my life recorded, tracked and organised.</p>\n<p>Now everything talks to everything else and I have a strict workflow to ensure any new information I find/ learn is archived and searchable for the future \u2013 as and when I need it.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve read a lot of books over the years and all my highlights, web clippings and quotes were just sitting dormant. Now I have a system to regurgitate that information on demand. It\u2019s class.</p>\n<p>Anyway, part of the upgrade was finally consolidating all my calendars into one. I had two business calendars (one for my own company and another for my consultancy work), a personal icalendar (that\u2019s linked to my apple devices), a google calendar, written appointments AND a bunch of random events stored under wierd subscriptions. <strong>That\u2019s 5 CALENDARS!</strong></p>\n<p>EVERY year, birthdays were disappearing from my feed and making plans was this long drawn out process as I would constantly double-book. Not anymore!</p>\n<p>The functionality to combine calendars is nothing new. If you\u2019re starting from scratch, it\u2019s pretty easy to pick one tool and work from there. However I totally underestimated the toll of managing multiple diaries day to day. It was exhausting. <strong>It seems pretty basic to write an entire post about how calendar consolidation changed my life, but 2 days in and it definitely feels this way!</strong></p>\n<p>Having your \u2018life\u2019 events and appointments simplified under one app is the greatest feeling. Almost a feeling of complete control. It allows me to effortlessly combine multiple businesses, relationships and commitments under one interface. Scheduling new calls and time away has become a breeze and toggling notifications is now one click instead of a few.</p>\n<p>The world is your oyster when choosing a tool, but I\u2019ve gone for <a href=\"https://flexibits.com/fantastical\"><u>Fantastical</u></a>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://thethirdblogdata.files.wordpress.com/2022/04/c1798-09afff_0c7c58b132a84a829279393924ff47camv2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you\u2019re searching for something, here are some features you may want to consider:</p>\n<h2 id=\"cloud-sync\">Cloud Sync</h2>\n<p>I want all my events, appointments and engagements to be identical across all my devices. Part of the old problem was that my calendars didn\u2019t \u2018speak\u2019 to each other. Device sync is important so you have real-time, up-to-date information on any device.</p>\n<h2 id=\"multi-device-integrations\">Multi-Device Integrations</h2>\n<p>As I mentioned \u2013 I work day to day across many different devices; ; phone, mobile, tablet, watch, laptop. If i\u2019m working from home, I want my calendar access to be via laptop. If i\u2019m on the move, i would prefer it from my iPhone. If i\u2019m in the gym, my watch is better. Having these integrations allows me to switch from one \u2018mode\u2019 of life to another, almost seamlessly. Work: Play. Leisure: Sport etc.</p>\n<h2 id=\"widgets\">Widgets</h2>\n<p>Customisation is always a fun thing for me. I love my work and life setup tailored as close to my personal preferences as possible. Changing themes, colours, sizing and style is an important factor for me when integrating any new tech into my life. With customisable widgets I can get all the info I need, displayed in the right way, from anywhere.</p>\n<h2 id=\"timezones-scheduling\">Timezones &amp; Scheduling</h2>\n<p>I live in Europe, but interact with clients and friends from all over the world. Traditionally, scheduling across time zones is messy and i\u2019m yet to find the \u2018perfect\u2019 solution. Either way, looking out for multi-region compatibility and language support can be a lifesaver when you have to arrange a call across multiple countries.</p>\n<p>Pretty crazy i\u2019ve written an entire blog about the joy I found consolidating my calendars, but there you go. If there\u2019s some friction with your own scheduling systems, why don\u2019t you try some housekeeping too. As you can see, I highly recommend it.</p>\n<p>T3B</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

The human: human interactions in a virtual world will no doubt be an evolutionary cornerstone of the technology. However, what interests me is the intersect between life and computer. Human and robot.</p><p>Artificial intelligence in the metaverse will have a profound impact on our experience. How will the advances in this technology affect those experiences? How will this also evolve?</p><p>This article attempts to address some of those questions and looks at some potential executions. I will definitely dig into greater depth on some of these topics as it\u2019s easy to get lost down the rabbit hole here. The potentials are staggering, the implications huge.</p><p>Anyway, enough drama. Let\u2019s get started:</p><h3 id=\"non-playable-characters-npc%E2%80%99s\"><strong>Non-playable characters (NPC\u2019s)</strong></h3><p>Since the very first games, NPC\u2019s have populated our virtual worlds. It\u2019s always been easy to tell these characters apart. They would stand or idle in restricted zones, have predictable conversations, offer predictable quests and always have a hovering icon above their heads to indicate interaction. Any \u2026 was more of an interaction than a conversation.</p><p>As technology evolves, so too have these wholesome characters. Interactions, graphics, animation all scaled to offer deeper complexity and realism. Essentially, AI chatbots have been integrated into walking, talking 3D avatars that give the illusion of self thought and contemplation.</p><p>An exciting development for the future is how predictive modelling could influence storyline and plot \u2013 where NPC\u2019s now make strategic decisions based on player activity to trick or confuse. Imagine a war strategy game where your opponent could observe and adapt based on your gameplay. This already exists with real-time strategy (RTS) games such as Age of Empires, but this level of learning and prediction could advance the genre to a whole new level.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphago\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><u>Alpha Go</u></a> was a computer program based on deep neural networks that did just this for the game Go. It used \u2018reinforcement learning\u2019 in games against itself to increase skill and win:rate \u2013 ultimately defeating a professional human in arguably the most complex game for AI.</p><p>Obviously there is a different conversation around \u2018how difficult\u2019 should a game be?\u2026but titles such as Diablo have a great system where you can increase difficulty almost indefinitely. Torment levels are essentially the same game but with increased loot, enemy health, damage and varying skills.</p><h4 id=\"deepfake-media\"><strong>Deepfake Media</strong></h4><p>You can take all this to the next level with deepfake technology. <a href=\"https://neonlife.ai/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><u>Neon</u></a>, a subsidiary of Samsung, recently released this \u2018vision of the future\u2019 where these next-level \u2018artificial humans\u2019 were presented as stylists, presenters and trainers.</p><p>This technology is slightly different, as they were modelled on real humans however imagine this on a larger and more refined scale. The Amazon original <a href=\"https://www.primevideo.com/detail/0NQ1QFP6B4R6TM8O2590IV5716/ref=atv_dp_share_cu_r\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><u>series Upload</u></a> also features a reality just like this! The power of an advanced deep learning AI in a human avatar \u2013 incredible.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hObhjF-5olU?autoplay=0&amp;mute=0&amp;controls=1&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thethirdblog.com&amp;playsinline=1&amp;showinfo=1&amp;rel=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;widgetid=1&amp;version=3&amp;showsearch=0&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\" style=\"max-width: 100%; inset: 0px; height: 483.75px; position: absolute; width: 860px; border: 0px;\"></iframe></figure><p>What starts to get very interesting are the potential applications of this tech outside of just gaming. Education has always been of great interest to me, so we\u2019ll start there.</p><h2 id=\"education-and-the-metaverse\"><strong>Education and the metaverse</strong></h2><p>During secondary school I started to question the learning process and the curriculum presented to kids aged 4-18. I was very fortunate to attend good schools but the experience was unequivocally boring. I have incredibly strong and fond memories of my primary school where I started at the age of 3. All classes were small, intentensly interactive, challenging and fostered an environment of failure. To quote a modern phrase, we would fail fast, learn fast. This certainly dropped off as I went through the school system.</p><p>Of course, some of this was due to age, but also curriculum and teaching style. Was any of this relevant, and why do I have to decide a career projection so early?</p><p>As I\u2019ve grown and chosen to seek knowledge on a whole range of topics, it\u2019s obvious that the world is not boring. Science and math is not boring but I certainly found it that way. What excites me about AI and the metaverse is it\u2019s potential to revolutionise education for everyone. By utilising some of the technology we\u2019ve already spoken about, the traditional classroom can be transformed into a virtual world of interactive and applied learning.</p><p>All of a sudden, maths isn\u2019t just a textbook with a bunch of arguable pointless exercises. Now, it\u2019s a money management simulation where you and your class have to control the finances for a theme park or create a budget to survive 12 months in a new city. This is real-world learning and something I felt was missing from the school experience. I will write a whole post on the education system as it is very close to my heart in terms of ideas I have for improvements, but for now let\u2019s stick to how the metaverse can help\u2026 This video from Meta (how could I not include them in this blog) is a great conversation starter for this industry:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KLOcj5qvOio?autoplay=0&amp;mute=0&amp;controls=1&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thethirdblog.com&amp;playsinline=1&amp;showinfo=1&amp;rel=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;widgetid=3&amp;version=3&amp;showsearch=0&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\" style=\"max-width: 100%; inset: 0px; height: 483.75px; position: absolute; width: 860px; border: 0px;\"></iframe></figure><p>Side Note:</p><blockquote><em>I currently work for a medical company with a brand that supplies simulation equipment for medical training. Picture yourself as an aspiring surgeon. Without a real body to practice on, your options are VERY limited. These metaverse environments can be used to not only test skills but also simulate highly stressful scenarios. Scenarios such as surgery and war that traditionally get \u2018tested\u2019 on the \u2018front line\u2019. A place with zero second chances.</em></blockquote><h3 id=\"customised-learning-paths-assessment\"><strong>Customised learning paths &amp; assessment</strong></h3><p>Part of the difficulty teaching in a school environment is balancing time and resources to individual students. Many of my friends had additional tutors to fill the gap between what we were being taught and what we understood. After a set period of time, the class must progress to the next topic as we need to cover everything in the syllabus. Some students would get left behind, others would get bored.</p><p>What fascinates me about the potential of AI in the metaverse is customised learning paths for each student. We all progress in different subjects at a different pace. Some of us need to spend more time on one concept and less on another. AI can be used to assess, monitor and tweak learning paths for all students. Those that show a proficiency can move onto more advanced concepts and the help is there for the others that need it. At no point do you feel ostracised or overly-challenged as the system can identify and manage your interactions. A traditional hour lesson in the classroom, may now be 20 minutes of intense virtual activity in the metaverse. Study doesn\u2019t have to be boring and with this there are SO many options to make it exciting.</p><p><a href=\"https://research.duolingo.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><u>Duolingo research</u></a> is an entire science department delving into language, education and the crossroad with technology. One of their papers investigates a method for \u2018rapidly <a href=\"https://research.duolingo.com/papers/settles.tacl20.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><u>creating language proficiency assessments</u></a>\u2018 and then using this to tailor personalised learning plans. When you start to combine research like this and present applications in an environment driven my creativity and immersion \u2013 the possibilities are endless. I sound like a wacko-tech-visionary now, but stay with me.</p><p>The research is there, the tech is there. Imagine \u2018travelling\u2019 to Spain in the metaverse for your spanish class. No more reitering verb tables in a classroom, but instead face to face conversation practice in a Barcelona cafe. No more rehearsed stories about shopping with your parents on the weekend, but actionable phrases you can use and apply on holiday.</p><h3 id=\"instant-feedback\"><strong>Instant feedback</strong></h3><p>Language learning apps are a great segway into the metaverse as there is a lot of transferable tech into this space. Coding tools I\u2019ve been using over the past 6-12 months also have similar interfaces; Codecademy and Datacamp for instance.</p><p>The power of instant feedback in a educational setting is invaluable as the student can learn about mistakes, improvements and a simple \u2018 correct or incorrect\u2019 assessment immediately after completing an exam. No waiting, no stressing.</p><p>Teacher bias is removed from any marking and it frees up their time for more quality teaching. On average, teachers are spending up to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/survey-teachers-work-53-hours-per-week-on-average/2012/03/16/gIQAqGxYGS_blog.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><u>90 minutes extra a day grading tests</u></a>. This is not a good use of their time.</p><p><em>Disclaimer. I\u2019d like to mention here that teachers do they best they can do. the majority are in it for the right reasons and many throughout my life have made a lasting, positive impression and impact. It\u2019s now our responsibility through technology to make their lives easier and give students (of all ages) a better tailored, personalised and iterative learning experience. Teachers will never be replaced by AI, but there is a strong overlap with how it can support.</em></p><h4 id=\"private-tutors\"><strong>Private Tutors</strong></h4><p>Although I JUST said teachers will never be replaced, the metaverse opens up THE WORLD to the fingertips of anyone with access. Any student could attend a lecture by a world-leading scientist if it was hosted in the metaverse.</p><p>For two years I had spanish lessons with a tutor from Argentina. For me, it was a requirement to learn from a native. We met in person a couple of times and our learning material was always basic but sufficient \u2013 textbooks, videos, short stories. Imagine the possibilities when the environment is your \u2018textbook\u2019 instead. Immersion has a part to play in any learning journey and the metaverse enamates this.</p><p>Could you also hire an AI tutor with the appearance of a NEON avatar? Would this be cheaper? They\u2019d always be available, willing, upbeat and entirely focused on you. You could study in your own time and the syllabus would constantly adapt to your level. There\u2019s a lot of benefits when done right.</p><p>I mentioned virtual lectures just now so let\u2019s move onto entertainment and how some of this could realistically be executed. <em>Plot twist \u2013 it\u2019s already happening!</em></p><h2 id=\"entertainment\"><strong>Entertainment</strong></h2><p>I recently stumbled across a site called <a href=\"https://www.virtualhumans.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><u>Virtual Humans</u></a> that totally blew my mind. As of today, Instagram has verified 35 virtual influencers on the platform. Let me make that clear, these aren\u2019t real people. They are computer generated avatars composited into the real world. The have real photos, a real following and can generate some serious money. PUMA recently chose <a href=\"https://www.virtualhumans.org/article/why-puma-chose-virtual-influencers-to-advertise-their-new-kosmo-rider-shoe\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><u>virtual influencers to advertise</u></a> their new shoe and other brands are lining up for the opportunities. <em>(Side note: building one of these personas could be a cool side-project!)</em></p><p>An anime music sensation know as Hatsune Miku, has sold out concerts both online and offline since her first appearance in 2007. Real-life artists are now taking to the metaverse to perform exclusive shows, concerts and custom entertainment. Artists such as Travis Scott, The Weeknd (a live tiktok experience) and Ariana Grande premiered her virtual concert on Fortnite with over 78 million players in attendance!

Now entire studios such as Warner Music Group are in discussion to make an <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/warner-music-wants-to-host-live-music-concerts-in-the-metaverse\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><u>ongoing concert series</u></a>.</p><p>There is a LOT to break down here, but you can already see the huge possibilities in this entertainment space. It may sound crazy to some, but as more of us become comfortable in digital spaces, this type of output is inevitable. Entertainment on demand has a whole new meaning.</p><h2 id=\"business-finance\"><strong>Business &amp; Finance</strong></h2><p>I started this article with the quote from Bill Gates around meetings in the metaverse. With the HUGE shift online since COVID, many people have had to accustom themselves to online work and it\u2019s been exhausting. Although at times it\u2019s been stressful, the transition has actually been very smooth. For the companies that can manage with Zoom it\u2019s been a great solution and one that will no doubt stand the test of time.</p><p><strong>We\u2019ve already seen new jobs arise and responsibilities change with this transition.</strong> Office managers and HR for one have had to adapt to the changing needs and stresses of a virtual environment. In a previous job, I saw these roles were suddenly responsible for arranging virtual team events and \u2018checking in\u2019 on mental health.</p><p>Funnily enough, a lot of middle management have also been struggling to justify their positions. With some of us working a lot more productively from home, it\u2019s harder to prove value when you can\u2019t been seen moving around and interacting at the office.</p><p>As part of the 2021 Sandbox teaser, they allude to 4 new digital jobs created from the metaverse; Architect, Land Owner, Hoster and Performer. A digital host is now a real thing. A real job. Just think about that!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg5vcdEeLOA&amp;t=60s\"><img src=\"https://thethirdblogdata.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/0e73c-09afff_922e0888f73d4f1fa88c8546f9f7ebc7mv2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></a></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg5vcdEeLOA&amp;t=60s\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Sandbox New Official Teaser 2021 \u2013 Gaming Virtual World with NFTs on the Blockchain</a></p><p>Moreover, the potential and possibility to move full-time into a more interactive space is easily done. Widespread adoption of the technology will be required, but if Microsoft was to release something with their teams app (for example), the barrier to entry would be silky smooth. When you start to combine this new environment with AI apps currently in circulation, you once again have the potential to revolutionise the industry.</p><p>AI note-taking apps could analysis, record and identify tasks from meetings. These tools already exist in a rudimentary form, but combine these with human/ robot avatars and they\u2019ll become almost like a member of the team. Virtual worlds that serve as the storefront to your business could have a 24/7 concierge or receptionist. Always available to answer any questions and no need to queue.</p><p>You can see this already starting to take shape in The Sandbox. Companies are buying up huge areas of digital real-estate to open concept stores, host virtual events and sell physical product. Imagine these new \u2018high streets\u2019 as the tutorial area for new players. It\u2019s like having a store on Oxford Street or the centre of New York. Players can explore, interact AND spend!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://thethirdblogdata.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/40328-09afff_8d5a79d007ba4c229dd277303dde5becmv2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Virtual Real Estate SOLD in The Sandbox</p><p>Recruitment systems could be augmented to provide virtual interview environments. These spaces and interactions would allow instant feedback and the chance for more complex testing. Imagine hiring for new 3D artists. You could invite 10 applicants to the same space (or virtual office), ask them to model something live in front of a panel and see how it fits into the company brand. The Sandbox already has over 3400 assets on it\u2019s marketplace \u2013 give it a year and see how this number will explode!</p><h3 id=\"language-and-communication\"><strong>Language and Communication</strong></h3><p>The final thing I wanted to touch on is how communication and language will evolve in the metaverse. AI has already begun to transform how humans communicate with each other. Headphones now exist that can translate languages in real-time, essentially removing the friction between current communication. This was best described in an article I found on Medium entitled, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@danilopena/the-language-of-the-metaverse-1880575da2c4\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><u>The Language of the Metaverse</u></a>:</p><blockquote>In the metaverse, I suspect we will have a native \u201cGoogle Translate\u201d that will convert our speech into the speech of the person\u2019s native tongue of whom we are conversing with. And vice versa.</blockquote><p>In the metaverse you could seamlessly live your life. Chat, collaborate and build with other players from all over the world and only speak one language. Perhaps this is your primary tongue or another more native to the virtual world. This sort of technology has been seen in sci-fi films for years but is now very much a reality.</p><p>It opens the door to international business, new friendships and maybe love. \ud83d\ude09</p><h2 id=\"summary\"><strong>Summary</strong></h2><p><strong>To finish as I begun, the metaverse is coming.</strong> With it comes a whole range of new technologies, experiences, jobs, entertainment and relationships. The intersect with this and artificial intelligence will continue to transform the way we communicate and live day to day. How both evolve in tandem will be interesting to observe. The rise of virtual influencers will play a key role in accelerating this end-state vision. With key real-life figures spearheading the adoption of the wider technology.</p><p>Somethings may sound far-fetched but an entire generation of humans have been born and raised online. We already play games, we chat and we play in virtual apps and worlds. Taking it to the next level is only a step away.</p><p>There is so much here that i\u2019d like to investigate deeper. As I improve my own knowledge of coding and machine learning, perhaps there are also some projects and assets I can contribute to the field. Either way, there is a lot to unpack.</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p>",

The second on that list is: <strong>What was the best thing you built/created?</strong></p>\n<p>Sadly, and for no other fault than my own, for many years the answer to this question was very little. With so much information and media available to us, it\u2019s easy to end up down the YouTube rabbit hole every night. I deleted all my social media over 5 years ago, but there is ALWAYS another outlet vying for your attention.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://thethirdblogdata.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/0eb36-11062b_62dd3d35c78d45b29f2c1e7cc03c496bmv2.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n<p>There\u2019s also two quotes from Elon Musk where he says something along the lines of:</p>\n<blockquote>\u2018<strong><em>NEWS FLASH</em><em> \u2013 If people don\u2019t build new stuff. There is NO new stuff</em></strong>\u201c.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\u2018Too many smart people work in Finance and Law. Not enough smart people are building things.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p>These were from his Joe Rogan Podcast #1470 \u2013 <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/08t3BnVDXUn4YQVuDohhYg\"><u>link here</u></a>.</p>\n<p>All three of these things struck a chord with me. Most of my life I\u2019ve been consuming a whole lot more than I was creating/ contributing to the world. <strong>This is a problem. </strong>This blog helps alleviate some of this <em>low</em> feeling, but also accentuates the power of coding. If you have an idea for a website, app, device, automation \u2013 whatever it may be \u2013 you can build it yourself.</p>\n<p>Life sounds a lot more interesting when you can engineer tools to compliment it!</p>\n<p>There are also a HOST of other activities that can contribute rather than consume. Do some art, write a poem, teach a skill. It might not be the easiest and you may have to convince yourself but I reckon it\u2019s worth it.</p>\n<p>Writing a book has also been a goal of mine for many years. I have fond memories filling notebooks with short stories, planning elaborate plots and perfecting my storytelling. Throughout my 31 years I\u2019ve even finished TWO BOOKS. This sounds amazing but I never published them. Now more than ever, this is the easiest thing to do. Fear took over. In my mind there were too many barriers. Some of them were:</p>\n<h3 id=\"getting-over-ego\">Getting over Ego</h3>\n<p>This is one of the BIG things I had to address. Who would be interested? Do I know enough to share with others? These were questions constantly flying through my mind. Self promotion comes easy to some but NOT to me. I\u2019m happy working silently in the shadows but there is great value in personal perspective and view. I journal in my personal life weekly. What\u2019s the difference to sharing some of my more creative thoughts and projects online?</p>\n<p>The downside is actually very little.</p>\n<p>Austin Kleon wrote a great book called \u2018<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Show-Your-Work-Austin-Kleon/dp/076117897X\"><u>Show your work</u></a>\u2018. I have to remind myself to re-read this constantly as it\u2019s an incredible insight to the power of sharing your skills and your ideas with the world.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-will-my-friends-family-think\">What will my friends/ family think?</h3>\n<p>This was another big one. I used to be a serial perfectionist and would only share things that were complete in my mind. All the way down to thoughts and feelings \u2013 unless they were concrete and logical, what\u2019s the point in airing it?</p>\n<p>Building or creating would easily take a back-seat when there is so much other content to see and do. What will my family think if they see I write a daily blog? What will my friends say if they read some of my content?</p>\n<p>I have a close friend who has chronicled his life online for MANY years. Even in secondary school he was writing blogs and recording videos to share with his \u2018network\u2019 \u2013 at the start, just friends and family. He is without a doubt one of the most inspirational people I know and I admire his wisdom and confidence to share his achievements and failures with the world. I only have admiration for my friends who create more than they consume and I would do well to replicate their actions in my own life.</p>\n<p>The cold hard truth is \u2013 no one really cares what you get up to unless it impacts them. Once you get over that, it\u2019s a lot easier to get started.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sticking-with-it\">Sticking with it</h3>\n<p>Consistency is the key to everything. Another great book entitled <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-James-Clear-audiobook/dp/B07RFSSYBH/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=atomic+habits&amp;qid=1648203060&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=atomic%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C189&amp;sr=1-1\"><u>Atomic Habits</u></a>, details the impact of small, CONSISTENT action. Often, it\u2019s not the big, elaborate actions that give the greatest results \u2013 but the smaller day to day activities. You won\u2019t see an immediate effect, but over the years it\u2019s cumulative.</p>\n<p>You can break this down with anything. Writing a novel is a scary endeavor. Writing a page a day is less so. It\u2019ll take you much longer but you\u2019ll still get it done eventually. This is slightly pulling away from the topic of \u2018consistency\u2019, but breaking HUGE tasks down into smaller manageable ones makes it easier to maintain.</p>\n<p>If you love to write \u2013 a short story every 6 months sounds atrocious. Fast forward 10 years and you\u2019ll have a bible.</p>\n<p>Anyway \u2013 i\u2019ve rambled here, but the idea is to CREATE MORE than I consume this year. Let\u2019s put my creativity to the test and see what I can do!</p>\n<p>T3B</p>",

      "content_html": "<p>Working through the Codecademy Python 3 course, I now have a good understanding of control flow, lists and functions. As I was progressing through the course, loops were always causing issues so I spent the majority of the last 2 weeks touching up on my knowledge.</p>\n<p>Unexpectedly, I got a little ill (no COVID) so my daily learning skid to a halt slightly. However, we are now over 80% through the Codecademy course and I reckon I can complete it this week. A lot of my weaker areas I\u2019ve been able to refine slightly over the past 14 days and now it\u2019s just a few of the final projects left. The <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3/modules/learn-python3-loops/cheatsheet\"><u>loop cheat sheet</u></a> from Codecademy was definitely a big help. List comprehension was driving me mad.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://thethirdblogdata.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/ab736-09afff_dd562171cef64c9285004eee38553fd9mv2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n<p>Something I thought about this morning is WHY I\u2019m doing this project. There is a tool I\u2019d love to build and a bit of python knowledge will allow me to do this. I also think the AI industry is fascinating, and I know with the right training, there is a lot I\u2019ll be able to add.</p>\n<p>Holding on to this has been a key driver in completing this course. Although I am only at the start of this journey, I\u2019ve read up on the importance of completing small real-life projects as soon as possible. Always having this end goal in the background is an amazing driving force.</p>\n<p>For now, I will keep dreaming of loops and try to complete this first course.</p>\n<p>T3B</p>",

      "content_html": "<p>The site launched yesterday, but in reality, I\u2019m 2 weeks into the process. I will outline the long-term plan in another post, but for now, I turned to Codecademy (I subscribed to PRO) to learn the basics of Python. I\u2019m currently on the <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3\">Python 3</a>course and progressing well.</p>\n<p>This will give me an understanding of the basics and an introduction to the language, how to think like a programmer and see if I\u2019m really cut out for this journey. I\u2019ve done martial arts all my life and am a key advocate of discipline and consistency when it comes to acquiring a new skill. Working on building my Python knowledge and becoming comfortable with the language is the very first step.</p>\n<p>For the past 2 weeks, I\u2019ve been piling in as many hours as possible. The more comfortable I get with the code, the faster the basics will start to fall into place.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://thethirdblogdata.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/84f41-b1ce291ed95c483292db01846c10e734.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n<p>People always laugh when I say this, but I love excel. Some of the formula structure has helped me progress throughout the Python course, but as I get into Dictionaries, Files and Classes \u2013 progress has slowed.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve got through 70% of the course in 2 weeks but there\u2019s a lot of new concepts and syntax that needs to be drilled in. Even if I can\u2019t remember everything at once my knowledge of what is possible is growing and this is half the battle. I\u2019m also having a big issue getting my head around LOOPS and will be focusing on this in the upcoming weeks.</p>\n<p>Practice needs to be at the edge of your comfort zone and I\u2019m enjoying the new challenges but it\u2019s not easy. The course suddenly takes a turn where you\u2019re learning multiple new code and syntax in every lesson. Anyway, piece by piece it will come together.</p>\n<p>Something I\u2019ve found very useful to split up my day is a Pomodoro timer. I\u2019ve been a productivity freak for much of my life (part of this blog and journey is to automate more of my tasks) but I\u2019ve never given this a serious go. With work and a bunch of other commitments, a slick Pomodoro addon for my MacBook has been invaluable.</p>\n<p>Something else I\u2019d also like to mention here is what Python life will be like off-platform and away from Codecademy. I\u2019ve setup the system on my mac but it is still a very unfamiliar interface. Once I\u2019ve finished this course I will head straight into actionable projects and see what I can do with my newfound knowledge in a \u2018real life\u2019 scenario.</p>\n<p>T3B</p>",
