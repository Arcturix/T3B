This includes photoaging, characterised by wrinkles and hyperpigmentation, and an increased risk of skin cancers like melanoma. </p><p>The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) advocates for regular use of broad-spectrum sunscreens with an SPF of 30 or higher as a standard in daily skincare routines. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../assets/images/Chesterton-s-Fence-20.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1118" height="842" srcset="../assets/images/Chesterton-s-Fence-20.jpg 600w, ../assets/images/Chesterton-s-Fence-20.jpg 1000w, ../assets/images/Chesterton-s-Fence-20.jpg 1118w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>A further article from the AAD, 'See how the sun damages your skin', demonstrates the <a href="https://www.aad.org/public/everyday-care/sun-protection/sun-damage-skin/hidden-sun-damage" rel="noreferrer">unseen damage of UV</a> throughout a lifetime.

Begin by setting a goal to drink a specific amount of water each day. Pair this with a morning and evening skincare routine that includes a hydrating moisturizer. </p><p>For sun protection, make applying a broad-spectrum sunscreen a non-negotiable part of your morning routine, regardless of the weather. Remember, UV rays can penetrate clouds and windows, making sunscreen essential even on cloudy days and indoors.</p><blockquote>UVB rays, the primary sunburn ray, are largely blocked by glass; but&nbsp;<strong>more than 50 percent of UVA rays, the main cause of premature&nbsp;skin aging, can penetrate glass</strong>. - <a href="https://www.skincancer.org/blog/sneaky-ways-youre-being-exposed-to-the-suns-uv-rays/#:~:text=UVB%20rays%2C%20the%20primary%20sunburn,the%20rays%20will%20reach%20you." rel="noreferrer">SkinCancer.org</a></blockquote><p><u>For a more direct plan to implement skincare simplexity, follow these steps:</u></p><ol><li><strong>Hydration:</strong><ul><li>Start your day by drinking a glass of water.</li><li>Throughout the day, keep a water bottle handy and sip regularly.</li><li>Use a hydrating cleanser and moisturizer morning and night.</li><li>Consider a hydrating serum or mask once or twice a week.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Sun Protection:</strong><ul><li>Apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 every morning.</li><li>Reapply sunscreen every two hours if you're outdoors.</li><li>Incorporate protective clothing, hats, and sunglasses for added sun protection.</li></ul></li></ol><p>By integrating these simple steps into your daily routine, you can effectively maintain skin hydration and protection against sun damage.</p><h3 id="red-light-therapy-a-modern-addition-to-skincare-simplexity"><strong>Red Light Therapy: A Modern Addition to Skincare Simplexity</strong></h3><p>Red Light Therapy (RLT) has recently emerged as a promising addition to the Simplexity approach.

        </div><p><strong>Benefits of Red Light Therapy in Skincare</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Collagen Production:</strong> RLT is known for its potential to boost collagen, a protein that gives skin its firmness and elasticity.</li><li><strong>Reducing Inflammation:</strong> It may help in reducing skin inflammation, assisting in conditions like acne or rosacea.</li><li><strong>Skin Healing:</strong> RLT can aid in the skin's healing process, helping to repair sun damage, scars, and other skin issues.</li></ol><p><strong>Incorporating RLT into Your Routine</strong><br>Adding RLT to your skincare regimen is straightforward. Many spas and clinics offer professional RLT sessions. For home use, numerous handheld devices, panels and masks are available, making it easy to incorporate this therapy into your daily routine. Personally, I have a <a href="https://www.mitolight.com" rel="noreferrer">Mito Light Panel</a>. It's pricey, but it brings the convenience to your home and doubles as a full-body recovery device for workouts. </p><p>As always, it's essential to follow the manufacturer's guidelines and consult with a skincare professional to ensure the best approach for your skin type and concerns.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: The Beauty of Simplicity</strong><br>Skincare doesn’t have to be complex to be effective. By focusing on hydration and sun protection, two fundamental aspects of skin health, we can make significant strides in preserving and enhancing our skin's natural beauty. Simplexity reminds us that sometimes, the simplest routines can lead to the most significant results.</p><p>Thanks for reading. </p><p>T3B</p><div class="kg-card kg-toggle-card" data-kg-toggle-state="close">
