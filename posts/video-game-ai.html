            <p>I read an interesting article by Keith Stuart at The Guardian ‘<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/jul/19/video-gaming-artificial-intelligence-ai-is-evolving"><u>Think, fight, feel: how video game artificial intelligence is evolving</u></a>‘. He had an interesting narrative about how the use of AI is transforming our in-game interactions. Traditionally NPCs have been static, pre-programmed, boring characters. I used to play a lot of PC/ Console games and it’s obvious to tell a real-player from an in-game character. This has never been an issue, however as storylines evolve and the player has a larger impact on the outcome, NPCs that also evolve is going to be a key component of gameplay.</p>
<p>These new characters can mimic human players. <strong>Now, this is exciting.</strong></p>

<p>What prompted me to write this small post is the potential for AI across a whole host of other industries. We read a lot about AI in business and on a daily basis I see new AI-driven software, however, there are so many applications in other arenas.</p>
<p>I had a quick think and came up with the below as talking points.</p>
<p><strong>Gaming</strong> – we can’t start here without mentioning Alpha Go. Training, new strategy, adaptive NPCs. Progressive difficulty could be amazing. Let the game increase in complexity and rewards based on the player level.</p>
<p><strong>Education</strong> – I’m yet to see an AI-powered language acquisition tool. This would be sweet. How about adapting a digital textbook to a child?</p>
<p><strong>Healthcare</strong> – Diagnosis and Automation. Give medical professionals the face-time they need with clients. How much of the day-to-day can be automated or sped up with the intervention of AI?</p>
<p><strong>Business</strong> – there are so many processes that can be automated in a business environment. Let’s make room for creativity and automate the minutae. How many hours a week could we save without answering pointless emails or undergoing the same old tasks.</p>
<p>Sports, Travel, Martial Arts, Job Search – wow there are so many applications.</p>
<p>I might turn this into a mini series as I’d really like to delve deep into one topic to fully explore the potentials.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p>
