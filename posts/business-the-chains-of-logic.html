            <p>In the world of business, it’s easy to get caught up in the pursuit of logic and efficiency. After all, logic is the driving force behind many decision-making processes and strategic planning. However, when everyone follows the same logical path, it can lead to a lack of creativity and excitement, resulting in businesses that are indistinguishable from one another. In this post, I explore the problems of prioritising logic and masking creativity.</p><blockquote>“when you demand logic, you pay a hidden price: you destroy magic”― RORY SUTHERLAND, ALCHEMY</blockquote><p>Logic is a powerful yet predictable tool.</p><p>It helps streamline processes, maximize efficiency, and ensure that decisions are based on sound reasoning. However, <strong>when every business adheres strictly to logic, the result is a very predictable landscape</strong>. Take one look at a string of competitors’ websites and each are nearly as indistinguishable as the next. The same style, the same messaging, the same model. “We offer the best product, the best service and the best value in the market.” BORING!</p><blockquote>It is much easier to be fired for being illogical than it is for being unimaginative. The fatal issue is that logic always gets you to exactly the same place as your competitors.― RORY SUTHERLAND, ALCHEMY</blockquote><p>Creativity, on the other hand, is the force that drives innovation and sets businesses apart. It’s the source of unexpected ideas, memorable experiences, and game-changing breakthroughs. Creativity is what allows businesses to break free from the mold and take risks that can lead to remarkable success. When creativity is allowed to thrive, businesses can stand out in a sea of sameness and create a lasting impression on their customers.</p><p>The key to avoiding the monotony of an overly logical business landscape lies in finding the right balance between logic and creativity. By combining the analytical power of logic with the imaginative energy of creativity, businesses can develop unique products, services, and marketing strategies that not only make sense but also captivate their audience.</p><p>So how can you do that? I’m glad you asked, here are some ideas:</p><ul><li><strong>Encourage a culture of experimentation</strong>: Foster an environment where employees feel comfortable sharing unconventional ideas and trying new approaches. This can lead to breakthrough innovations that differentiate your business from competitors.</li><li><strong>Embrace storytelling</strong>: Instead of focusing solely on data-driven messaging, incorporate storytelling into your marketing efforts to create emotional connections with your audience. A compelling story can make your brand unforgettable and resonate deeply with customers.</li><li><strong>Prioritize design</strong>: Pay attention to the design aspects of your products, services, and online presence. A unique and visually appealing design can make your brand stand out and leave a lasting impression on your customers.</li><li><strong>Diversify your team</strong>: A diverse team, with members from different backgrounds and expertise, can bring fresh perspectives and ideas to the table. Encourage collaboration and open dialogue to fuel creativity and innovation within your business.</li><li><strong>Keep an eye on trends, but don’t be afraid to challenge them</strong>: Stay informed about industry trends, but don’t be afraid to challenge the status quo. Sometimes, going against the grain can lead to groundbreaking solutions and help your business stand out from the competition.</li></ul><p>While logic is an essential component of business success, it’s crucial not to neglect the power of creativity. By striking the right balance between the two, businesses can create unique and exciting experiences that leave a lasting impression on their customers and set them apart from the competition.</p><p>So, let’s embrace the excitement of creativity and make our businesses stand out in a world of similarity. No more clone-wars branding and doppelgänger messaging. Pick something new, tell a story and stand out from the crowd.</p><p>Good luck.</p><p>T3B</p>
