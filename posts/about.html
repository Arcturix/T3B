I’ll be honest. This isn’t my third blog…

This is the umpteenth blog I’ve created in my lifetime.

Probably in the mid-thirties. I build websites, pack them with content, stay committed for a few months then wipe the slate clean and start a new project. I w" />

I build websites, pack them with content, stay committed for a few months then wipe the slate clean and start a new project. I work with digital technology every day and I’m never short on business ideas and side projects yet I can never stick with one long enough to see it through.</p><p>The Third Blog is the blog I stick with…as this time I’m not doing it for anyone else but me. </p><p><strong>It will be an odyssey of curiosity and self-reflection</strong>. It's the canvas where I journal the "interesting, useful," and the thought-evoking.</p><p>Once a hub for my venture into Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, this space has morphed into a sanctuary for my musings. It's not about reaching out to the world, but reaching within, documenting insights that I may revisit, akin to a digital journal. It’s about the meditative cadence of penning down thoughts, fueled by an array of interests - productivity, minimalism, martial arts, languages, fitness, technology, and beyond.</p><p>I realised a few months ago, <strong>you don’t need to be an expert to write online</strong>. There is plenty of content out there and i’m just adding my voice to it. Self promotion has never come easy to me. It’s a lot more comfortable to just get the work done and move on. I happened to stumble across a book entitled “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Show-Your-Work-Austin-Kleon/dp/076117897X" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>Show Your Work</u></a>” by Austin Kleon which totally made me rethink the benefits of sharing online. The following two quotes are from him:</p><blockquote>“Make stuff you love and talk about stuff you love and you’ll attract people who love that kind of stuff. It’s that simple.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Teaching people doesn’t subtract value from what you do, it actually adds to it. When you teach someone how to do your work, you are, in effect, generating more interest in your work. People feel closer to your work because you’re letting them in on what you know.”</blockquote><p>So welcome to The Third Blog, a rendezvous with thoughts awaiting to be penned down, revisited, and reflected upon.<br></p><p>It’ll be raw, it’ll be honest. If anything helps you, or you have some advice, please join in the conversation.</p><p>T3B</p>
