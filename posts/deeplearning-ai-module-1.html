<p>One thing that’s been confirmed is the need for more mathematical knowledge. The start of this was easy to follow along, but it soon got very complicated. I’ll need to setup my understanding of formula and statistics to complete the rest.</p>
<p>Either way…very informative and fun course. What’s next!?</p>
