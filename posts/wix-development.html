<p>There is a range of emotions today after I complete one of the in-platform Wix coding challenges on Codecademy. I’m struggling to understand why you would code Javascript to change elements on the screen when you can just change them in the editor.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../assets/images/6cce2-11062b_def24fd12af149a485d986aaec7493dbmv2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>Yes, at times it might be beneficial to store values in variables and be able to reference them, but there are also workarounds for this on the front-end. Perhaps I need to remember that this is a beginner course and there is still a lot to go. Perhaps I need to work through this as methodically as I did with the Python course and just wait for things to fall in place.</p>
<p><strong>Perhaps</strong> I just need to skip ahead and see what lies further down the course.</p>
<p>This is a great point and something I need to remember.</p>
<p>Someone once told me, if you’re not enjoying a book, you are allowed to put it down. You don’t need to finish it. Also, why not skip ahead a bit and see if it picks up. I think I’ll apply this with the Wix course and see if it develops the way I want it to in order to achieve my goals.</p>
<p>Although I’m learning new things, I need to remember why I’m here. There are things I want to build and lessons I want to learn. If it’s not something that will benefit my end goal, it is okay to stop in the middle and move on to something more valuable.</p>
<p>Bear with me a week or so for another JavaScript update.</p>
