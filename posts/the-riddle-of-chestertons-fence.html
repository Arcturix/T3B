            <p>In our fast-paced world, we are often eager to make changes, disrupt the status quo, and challenge the traditional way of doing things. But what if there was a wisdom in first understanding why things are the way they are before attempting to change them? This is the central theme behind the fascinating concept known as "Chesterton's Fence". </p><p>Changes in leadership often begin with what I call 'the Big Bang'. In order to show the board or the investors they aim to make significant change, they will tend to make a big (often over the top) proposal in the first 4-6 weeks. This could be huge layoffs, discontinued systems, organisation restructure etc. </p><p>Often...this is exactly why they were hired...but I would caution haste. </p><p>Chesterton's Fence is a principle that originates from a metaphor by the writer G.K. Chesterton. He posited: </p><blockquote>before you remove a fence (or a law, a tradition, a practice), it's crucial to understand why it was put up in the first place.</blockquote><p>In Chesterton's words, "If a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly." By this, he meant that <strong>it's not sufficient to dismiss something as irrelevant or outdated just because it seems so on the surface</strong>. Instead, it's essential to fully understand its purpose, context, and the problem it was meant to address before discarding it.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../assets/images/Chesterton-s-Fence.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1118" height="842" srcset="../assets/images/Chesterton-s-Fence.jpg 600w, ../assets/images/Chesterton-s-Fence.jpg 1000w, ../assets/images/Chesterton-s-Fence.jpg 1118w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Chesterton's Fence</strong></b><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> - Do not take down a fence until you know why it was put up in the first place</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="why-chestertons-fence-matters">Why Chesterton's Fence Matters</h2><p>The concept of Chesterton's Fence reminds us to approach change with a sense of humility and respect for the wisdom embedded in existing systems. <strong>While it's easy to dismiss old practices or traditions as outmoded, they often carry the wisdom of previous generations and address issues that may not be immediately apparent</strong>.</p><p>This doesn't mean we should resist change, but rather, that we should approach it thoughtfully. By understanding the 'why' behind a 'fence', we can make more informed decisions about what to change and how to change it, and anticipate potential problems that the change could bring.</p><p>So, how do we apply this principle in our lives?</p><p>First, <strong>pause before you push for change</strong>. Ask questions, do your research, and make sure you fully understand the purpose of the 'fence' you're thinking of tearing down.</p><p>Second, engage with others.<strong> Seek the perspectives of those who have more experience or a different viewpoint</strong>. They might provide insights about the 'fence' that you hadn't considered.</p><p>Lastly, think critically and creatively. <strong>Is the 'fence' truly outdated, or does it serve a function that's still necessary?</strong> Is there a way to modernize the 'fence' or to achieve its function in a different way?</p><p>Chesterton's Fence is an age-old wisdom that encourages us to approach change with a mindful, inquisitive, and respectful attitude. In our quest for improvement and progress, let's not forget to pay heed to the wisdom of the past. I am a huge benefactor in helping businesses with digital transformation...but there's never hard in inspecting the fence first.</p><p>T3B</p>
