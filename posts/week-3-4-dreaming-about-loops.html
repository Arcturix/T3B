<p>Unexpectedly, I got a little ill (no COVID) so my daily learning skid to a halt slightly. However, we are now over 80% through the Codecademy course and I reckon I can complete it this week. A lot of my weaker areas I’ve been able to refine slightly over the past 14 days and now it’s just a few of the final projects left. The <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3/modules/learn-python3-loops/cheatsheet"><u>loop cheat sheet</u></a> from Codecademy was definitely a big help. List comprehension was driving me mad.</p>

<p>Something I thought about this morning is WHY I’m doing this project. There is a tool I’d love to build and a bit of python knowledge will allow me to do this. I also think the AI industry is fascinating, and I know with the right training, there is a lot I’ll be able to add.</p>
<p>Holding on to this has been a key driver in completing this course. Although I am only at the start of this journey, I’ve read up on the importance of completing small real-life projects as soon as possible. Always having this end goal in the background is an amazing driving force.</p>
<p>For now, I will keep dreaming of loops and try to complete this first course.</p>
