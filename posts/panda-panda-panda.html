<p>Getting to a stage where you learn actionable insights and begin to code off-platform is an exciting one. Todays lesson covered dictionaries and the Panda DataFrame. According to DataCamp, this is ‘<em>the de facto standard to work with tabular data in Python</em>‘.</p>
<p>I can now import, create, call, access and manipulate a database. I’m actually flying through this course much faster than expected. Yesterday I hypothesised 4-6 weeks. I’ll probably be done on Sunday. I’ve been waking up earlier and earlier and the mornings before work is the perfect time.</p>
<p>As yesterday, here are my rudimental notes on Panda code structure and syntax:</p>

<p>pd.read_csv('INSERT_DOCUMENT_PATH_HERE', index_col = 1)</p>
<p>I dug around my applications and found PyCharm which I was using last year. There was one small coded project where I was importing .csv files and calling data. Today’s lesson was very similar and a great recap.</p>
<p>A few things I had to clarify along the way once I was introduced to <strong>.loc</strong> and <strong>.iloc</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>.loc</strong> is used for label based access.<strong> [‘insert text here’]</strong></p>
<p><strong>.iloc</strong> is used for integer-position based access <strong>[2]</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Series VS DataFrame [‘La la la’] VS [[‘La la la]]</strong></p>
<p>A <strong>pandas series</strong> is a one-dimensional data structure that comprises of a key-value pair. It is similar to a python dictionary, except it provides more freedom to manipulate and edit the data.</p>
<p>A <strong>pandas dataframe</strong> is a two-dimensional data-structure that can be thought of as a <em>spreadsheet</em>. A dataframe can also be thought of as a <em>combination of two or more series</em>.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.educative.io/edpresso/series-vs-dataframe-in-pandas"><u>educative.io</u></a> for the definitions.</p>
<p>Peace out!</p>
