            <p>The site launched yesterday, but in reality, I’m 2 weeks into the process. I will outline the long-term plan in another post, but for now, I turned to Codecademy (I subscribed to PRO) to learn the basics of Python. I’m currently on the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3">Python 3</a>course and progressing well.</p>
<p>This will give me an understanding of the basics and an introduction to the language, how to think like a programmer and see if I’m really cut out for this journey. I’ve done martial arts all my life and am a key advocate of discipline and consistency when it comes to acquiring a new skill. Working on building my Python knowledge and becoming comfortable with the language is the very first step.</p>
<p>For the past 2 weeks, I’ve been piling in as many hours as possible. The more comfortable I get with the code, the faster the basics will start to fall into place.</p>

<p>People always laugh when I say this, but I love excel. Some of the formula structure has helped me progress throughout the Python course, but as I get into Dictionaries, Files and Classes – progress has slowed.</p>
<p>I’ve got through 70% of the course in 2 weeks but there’s a lot of new concepts and syntax that needs to be drilled in. Even if I can’t remember everything at once my knowledge of what is possible is growing and this is half the battle. I’m also having a big issue getting my head around LOOPS and will be focusing on this in the upcoming weeks.</p>
<p>Practice needs to be at the edge of your comfort zone and I’m enjoying the new challenges but it’s not easy. The course suddenly takes a turn where you’re learning multiple new code and syntax in every lesson. Anyway, piece by piece it will come together.</p>
<p>Something I’ve found very useful to split up my day is a Pomodoro timer. I’ve been a productivity freak for much of my life (part of this blog and journey is to automate more of my tasks) but I’ve never given this a serious go. With work and a bunch of other commitments, a slick Pomodoro addon for my MacBook has been invaluable.</p>
<p>Something else I’d also like to mention here is what Python life will be like off-platform and away from Codecademy. I’ve setup the system on my mac but it is still a very unfamiliar interface. Once I’ve finished this course I will head straight into actionable projects and see what I can do with my newfound knowledge in a ‘real life’ scenario.</p>
