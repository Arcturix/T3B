In a world increasingly cluttered with information overload, conflicting advice, and the relentless pursuit of more, this series is an oasis of clarity and simplicity.</div></div><p>In an era where financial advice is often complex and overwhelming, the principle of Financial Simplexity offers a refreshing and straightforward approach: live within your means. </p><p>This seemingly simple advice is a powerful tool for achieving financial stability and freedom, applicable to individuals at all income levels.</p><div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-accent"><div class="kg-callout-emoji">💡</div><div class="kg-callout-text"><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">FIX FINANCES</strong></b> - LIVE WITHIN YOUR MEANS</div></div><h3 id="the-simplexity-approach"><strong>The Simplexity Approach</strong></h3><p><u>Living within your means</u> is fundamental for achieving long-term financial stability and peace of mind. It involves spending less than you earn, allowing you to save and invest, which in turn leads to building wealth over time. </p><p>This practice also helps in <u>avoiding the stress and constraints associated with debt</u>. (<em>People suffer sleepless nights about their finances, don't underestimate this</em>) By aligning spending habits with personal financial capabilities, individuals can enjoy a more balanced, secure lifestyle, and are better prepared for unexpected financial challenges. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../assets/images/Chesterton-s-Fence-24.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1118" height="607" srcset="../assets/images/Chesterton-s-Fence-24.jpg 600w, ../assets/images/Chesterton-s-Fence-24.jpg 1000w, ../assets/images/Chesterton-s-Fence-24.jpg 1118w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Use money creatively and strategically - Robert Greene</span></figcaption></figure><blockquote>“For everyone able to play with money, thousands more are locked in a self destructive refusal to&nbsp;use money creatively and strategically.” - Robert Greene</blockquote><p>I love this quote from Robert Greene as a daily reminder to use money creatively and strategically - NOT on useless physical or digital possessions. </p><h3 id="the-challenges-of-simplexity">The Challenges of Simplexity</h3><p>Adhering to a budget and living within one's means can be challenging in today's society, primarily due to factors like lifestyle creep, social comparisons, and managing major expenses.</p><p><strong>Lifestyle Creep</strong>: As income increases, so does spending, often subtly. This gradual increase in lifestyle costs can significantly derail financial goals.</p><p><strong>Social Comparisons</strong>: The influence of social media often creates unrealistic expectations for personal spending, leading to unnecessary expenditures to match perceived societal standards.</p><p><strong>The Big 3 - Rent, Travel, Food</strong>: These major expenses are common areas of overspending. Careful planning and prioritization are required to manage these costs effectively as they can easily spiral out of control. (For example, the average monthly car payment in the UK is <a href="https://cardealermagazine.co.uk/publish/average-monthly-car-finance-payments-revealed-as-research-reveals-cash-still-popular-among-buyers/218942#:~:text=The%20average%20amount%20of%20money,fund%20their%20last%20car%20purchase." rel="noreferrer">£350</a> and in the US it's <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/loans/auto-loans/average-monthly-car-payment/#:~:text=the%20best%20deal.-,Car%20payment%20statistics,for%20used%20cars%20is%20%24533." rel="noreferrer">$726</a>. <strong>MADNESS</strong>) </p><p><u>Depending on your income level, HUGE sacrifices might have to be made here</u>.

This classic book, written by George S. Clason, offers invaluable advice on managing personal finances. </p><p>One of its most significant lessons is the importance of saving at least 10% of your income. This simple act of saving a small portion of your earnings can lead to substantial wealth over time, demonstrating that <u>financial security is not solely dependent on how much you earn</u>, but rather how much you save.</p><p>Saving is a habit and it’s nice to cultivate that habit as soon as you can. You’ll see a bunch of ‘out of touch’ savings videos on YouTube (how I saved 10,000 in a year, how I paid 200k student debt in 12 months) - but for the ’average Joe’, no matter what you earn, this is a nice starting point. </p><h3 id="lessons-from-mrmoney-moustache">Lessons from Mr.Money Moustache</h3><p>Mr. Money Mustache, a popular figure in the personal finance sphere, emphasises the value of frugality and <u>living well below one's means</u> to achieve early financial independence. </p><p>His lessons revolve around <strong>aggressive saving</strong>, <strong>wise investing</strong>, and <strong>lifestyle simplification</strong>. (<em>This is not a T3B investment/ how to grow your money post</em>), but by focusing on reducing unnecessary expenses and valuing long-term financial well-being over immediate gratification, Mr. Money Moustache provides a blueprint for achieving financial freedom much earlier than traditional retirement age. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../assets/images/years_to_retirement.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="982" height="400" srcset="../assets/images/years_to_retirement.png 600w, ../assets/images/years_to_retirement.png 982w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Working years vs. Savings Rate (screenshot from&nbsp;</span><a href="https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement?income=70000&amp;initialBalance=0&amp;expenses=25200&amp;annualPct=5&amp;withdrawalRate=4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">networthify.com</span></a><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">)</span></figcaption></figure><blockquote>The average savings rate is 6%.

This is the money that can be used for savings, investments, or spending on meaningful experiences. </p><p>The key is to use this portion of your income wisely, balancing immediate enjoyment with long-term financial goals. Financial Simplexity encourages investing in experiences over material possessions, as experiences tend to provide longer-lasting satisfaction and happiness.</p><p>Alongside this, here is a nice guide from ALUX about where to spend your money. It's all mentioned here, but don't skimp on; <strong>health</strong>, <strong>education</strong> and your <strong>loved ones</strong>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JvrTEGksrtg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" title="15 Things You Should Spend Money On"></iframe></figure><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Financial Simplexity is more than just a financial strategy; it's a mindset. Living within your means is not easy for anyone at any income level. As mentioned, lifestyle creep is a real thing that can catch anyone out. It encourages a balanced approach to personal finance, combining wise spending, consistent saving, and thoughtful decision making throughout life.</p><p>By embracing the principles of Financial Simplexity, you can navigate the complexities of personal finance with confidence and ease, setting the stage for a secure and fulfilling financial future.</p><p>Good luck and thanks for reading.</p><p>T3B</p><div class="kg-card kg-toggle-card" data-kg-toggle-state="close">
