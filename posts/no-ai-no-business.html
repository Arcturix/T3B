            <p>Today something interesting happened…</p><p>A potential client said they weren’t interested in working with us because we DON’T utilise AI in any of our products. The conversation went something like this:</p><blockquote>“We have a team of dedicated experts.”<br><br>“Experts make errors. We want fast, reliable deliverables from AI-powered businesses.”</blockquote><p>With this buzzword plastered all over the news and the implication that AI is currently this all powerful utility that will takeover our lives and transform our businesses…(take a breath) It made me think of the effect this has on consumers and the demand they bring to their purchases.</p><blockquote>If AI has the <em>potential</em> to make you top tier, does no-AI instantly make you bottom-tier?</blockquote><p>If this is the perception, then regardless of the reality this is a big problem. Even without AI, businesses can still create successful products and services that consumers enjoy. AI may speed up certain processes and provide businesses with additional insights, but businesses can still certainly operate effectively without it.</p><p>Maybe this will change…but it was a courious remark from an unlikely source. For so long the ‘fickle’ crowd have been weary of even the term AI. Now for some, it’s instantly a necessity.</p><p><em>Now with my marketing hat on</em> – whether you’re using AI or not, it’s important to ensure that customer experience is always of utmost importance – it’s the ONLY way to guarantee customer satisfaction and any slither of loyalty in this digital age.</p><p>Businesses should strive to create an environment where customers feel they are getting value, satisfaction, and great experiences. AI-powered processes can be a powerful tool, but it’s important to remember that it’s only a tool.</p><p>For now…muhahaha.</p><p>T3B</p>
